Advisory Committee: Professors: DICKERSON, A. WILLINGHAM. Associate Professors:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The aim of the program of Afro-American Studies is to allow students to
consolidate some of their course elections in the social sciences and humanities
focusing on the history, culture, and social experience of Africans and their
descendants in the Western Hemisphere.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All students enrolled as concentrators in the Afro-American Studies program
are required to complete a total of five courses in the program, including
a culminating senior independent study project (491 or 492) and one Winter
Study Project dealing with a subject relevant to the objectives of the program.
Winter Study Projects not offered by the program should be approved by the
chair.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Senior projects may be done in the fall or spring semester. They will be
evaluated by the project advisor and reviewed by the chair of the program.
Students must propose their projects and secure an advisor by no later than
the end of registration of the semester in which they are enrolled in 491
or 492. The chair may modify the requirements for the Senior Project in
exceptional circumstances.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

HONORS PROGRAM IN AFRO-AMERICAN STUDIES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Candidates for honors in Afro-American Studies must maintain at least a B+
average in the concentration and be admitted to candidacy by the program
faculty. In addition to the regular requirements for the concentration,
candidates for honors are also required to take one course specifically related
to their Senior Project (see above). It is also required that honors candidates
devote one independent study course (491 or 492) and their senior year Winter
Study to the completion of their Senior Project. That Winter Study may also
serve to fill the regular Winter Study Project requirement for the concentration.
Honors Senior Projects should demonstrate unusual creativity, depth, and
intellectual rigor.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Candidates for honors are permitted and encouraged to pursue non-traditional
projects, such as presentations in the performing arts, visual arts, or creative
writing, as well as more traditional interdisciplinary studies. Honors Senior
Projects will be evaluated by the advisor, and the program faculty will decide
whether honors should be conferred. Students wishing to become candidates
for honors in Afro-American Studies should inform the chair of the program
in writing before spring registration of their junior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
THE AFRO-AMERICAN STUDIES CONCENTRATION AND THE AMERICAN STUDIES MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Several courses in Afro-American Studies count for credit in the American
Studies major. Therefore, students in American Studies can easily complete
requirements for an Afro-American Studies concentration by electing one course
in an African subject and by taking Afro-American Studies 491. Another three
courses must be chosen which satisfy both American Studies and Afro-American
Studies requirements.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
African and Middle Eastern Studies is an interdisciplinary program focusing
on the politics, societies, cultures, and historical development of the peoples
of Africa and the Middle East. The program offers a wide range of courses
in the area, as well as opportunities to study abroad and possibilities for
graduate fellowships and careers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students considering completing the concentration are urged to register with
the Chair of the program during their sophomore year. Normally, students
will be expected to take six courses from at least three different departments.
One of these courses should be from among the "Concepts Courses" listed below.
Four should be from the "Core Courses." The sixth course will be African
and Middle Eastern Studies 401 or 402. In special cases the Chair may permit
substitution of an approved Winter Study Project, or work completed elsewhere,
for one or more of the electives. Proposals for Honors Work in African and
Middle Eastern Studies, normally involving at least a one semester thesis
and an oral examination, must be submitted in writing by the beginning of
the senior year and approved by the African and Middle Eastern Studies Committee.

off-campus program in Mystic, Connecticut. Students apply for either the
fall or the spring semester and take four of five courses offered. Students
also take part in a noncredit maritime skills class of their choice, choosing
from celestial navigation, sailing, music of the sea, ship smithing, and
the outdoor demonstration squad. Students live in cooperative houses at Mystic
Seaport and participate in field seminars to the Pacific Coast, Nantucket
Island, and New York harbor, as well as an all-day offshore trip as part
of their coursework. Interested students may obtain further information and
an application through the Dean's Office. An open house is held annually
in November. A personal interview is required. Admission is competitive.
Students must meet Williams College and Williams-Mystic application deadlines.

Chair, Associate Professor: REGINA G. KUNZEL

Faculty 1998-99: Associate Professor: KUNZEL. Assistant Professor: KENT,

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The American Studies Program uses interdisciplinary approaches to develop
students' understanding of the complexity of the culture(s) usually labeled
"American." Examining history, literature, and other forms of expression,
we explore the processes of cultural definition as contested by diverse
individuals and groups. We ask new questions about aspects of American life
long taken for granted; we also use American culture as a laboratory for
testing classic and contemporary theories about how cultures work.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
NON-MAJORS, FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS, AND SOPHOMORES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
American Studies 201 is open to non-majors including first-year students
with Advanced Placement credit in American History. All elective courses
are open to students who meet the requirements of the departments that sponsor
those courses. American Studies 302 and 403 are open to non-majors with
permission of the instructor.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
RATIONALE FOR COURSE NUMBERING
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The introductory course is offered at the 200 level to suggest the desirability
of some preliminary training in college-level history, literature, sociology,
or political science. The intermediate course, 302, is offered primarily
for Juniors, although it is open to Sophomores who have had 201 and will
be away from campus during the spring of their Junior year. 300-level independent
study courses are offered to upperclass students. 403 is designed for Senior
majors; it, like 302, is open to students who can demonstrate adequate
preparation to the instructor.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
THE MAJOR
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<I>Required major courses:</I>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
American Studies 201
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
American Studies 302
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
American Studies 403
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<I>Elective courses:</I>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eight courses: five should be chosen from one of the Specialization Fields
listed below, the other three chosen from among any of the electives listed.
Advanced Placement credit in appropriate areas, or departmental courses not
listed here, may be substituted for electives in the major, with permission
of the Program Chair.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN AMERICAN STUDIES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A student wishing to be a candidate for Honors in American Studies will undertake
a substantial independent project during Senior year, in American Studies
403, W030, and American Studies 492. The project will constitute the student's
independent work for American Studies 403, and grades for American Studies
403 and W030 will be deferred until thesis projects are completed in the
second semester. The awarding of Honors will be determined by the American
Studies Program Committee based on the recommendation of the student's project
advisor and two other faculty readers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Majors considering the Honors program are urged to consult as early as possible
with the Chair of the Program. Permission to pursue Honors will be contingent
upon the quality of performance in courses in the major (normally, a B+ average
will be the minimum requirement) and the recommendation of a faculty member
willing to be the student's project advisor.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
AMERICAN STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students majoring in American Studies are encouraged to consider pursuing
concentrations in Afro-American, Environmental, and Women's and Gender Studies.
Many of the courses counted for those concentrations may also earn credit
toward the American Studies major.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A major in American Studies can be combined with study away from Williams
for a semester or a year if plans are made carefully. Many courses that will
be approved for College credit may also count towards the American Studies
major if their subject matter is American culture. We encourage students
to pursue cross-cultural comparative studies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students planning to be away in the Junior year should have taken American
Studies 201 before they leave; those away for Junior-year spring term should
take American Studies 302 in their Sophomore year. (For the first two years
of this new requirement, the Chair of the Program may authorize a substitute
course if this plan is not workable.) Students should consult as early as
possible with the Chair about their plans for fulfilling the requirements
of the major.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
SPECIALIZATION FIELDS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To provide focus for work in the major, each student will choose one of the
Specialization Fields listed below and record this choice when registering
for the major. (This commitment can be revised, in consultation with the
Chair.) At least five electives will be taken from among those designated
to support a Specialization Field. In extraordinary cases, students who wish
to do so may be permitted to design their own Specialization Field. Fulfillment
of concentrations in Afro-American Studies, Environmental Studies, and Women's
and Gender Studies may be used as the basis for individually designed
Specialization Fields. All such arrangements must be approved by the American
Studies Committee.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>POLITICAL CULTURE</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many people claim that America is a representative democracy. But the term
"representation" harbors an instructive ambiguity. Sometimes the concept
is used to refer to governmental institutions and practices. Politics, however,
is also conducted through cultural representations-through, that is, the
images, symbols, icons and narratives we use to construct distinct identities
for ourselves. In important respects the production, organization, and
distribution of power occurs as a result of interplay between these governmental
and cultural processes of representation. This specialization affords students
the opportunity to investigate that process in detail.

<B>SOCIAL DIVERSITY: RE-IMAGINING AMERICA</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We often think of the United States as a large national community. Given
the geographical, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, however,
the ways in which Americans imagine this community inevitably vary from time
to time, place to place, and among different individuals and groups. Indeed,
the cultural landscape of America is more often than not a contested terrain,
in which different visions coexist and compete. This specialization offers
students an opportunity to consider some of the practical and speculative
ways in which historically less powerful social groups-such as Native Americans,
African Americans, gays and lesbians, working class Americans, immigrants
and other ethnic and regional minorities-attempt to rewrite the American
Story.

This specialization offers students an opportunity to consider the relations
between culture and the production of social meanings in genres ranging from
those traditionally thought of as elite (poetry, painting, orchestral music)
to those traditionally thought of as popular (movies, television, advertising,
and rock 'n roll). Drawing on diverse theoretical and methodological approaches
(material culture theory, literary history, iconography, semiotics, Frankfurt
school analysis, and so on), this specialization encourages students both
to investigate the relations between high and low culture and to reflect
on the nature and uses of cultural inquiry itself.

The time-honored description of American as "The Land of Opportunity" presupposes
that capitalism is far more than a system of economic production. It is indeed
a potent myth, around which a whole series of cultural narratives-in celebration
of it, in opposition to it-have been organized. This specialization challenges
students to examine the various ways in which different Americans have sought
to measure, explain, and justify their individual and collective economic
performances. Who "makes it" in America? How? Why?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams aims to help students
achieve an integrated understanding of biography, history, culture, and social
structure in both traditional and modern societies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Anthropology explores the full range of human experience by introducing students
to the study of tribal and peasant societies, especially those on the periphery
of the West, as well as to the cultural complexities of stratified, industrial
societies such as our own. Integrated with the study of specific peoples
is an examination of the various analytical schemes anthropologists have
developed to understand them. Courses offered in the department represent
two of anthropology's major subfields: sociocultural anthropology-that is,
the comparative study of human social life, institutions, and beliefs-and
archaeology, the study of the origins and lifeways of prehistoric peoples.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sociology studies the social and institutional intricacies of modern industrial
societies and the social psychological dilemmas facing the individual in
our epoch. Sociology courses introduce students to classical and contemporary
social thought about men and women and society, to the systematic analysis
of social institutions and social interaction, and to the social analysis
of modern culture. The Sociology major at Williams emphasizes the humanistic
tradition of sociology, stressing qualitative approaches to understanding
how social reality is constructed.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJORS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department offers separate majors in both Anthropology and Sociology,
with a broad and diverse array of courses in both disciplines. The Department
is committed, however, to the unity of the social sciences. To this end,
Anthropology and Sociology offer joint core courses in methodology and theory,
as well as several elective courses in common. All joint courses are designated
"ANSO."
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<I>Requirements</I>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the degree in Anthropology or Sociology, students must complete a minimum
of nine courses as outlined below:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(1) Core Courses. Majors in both disciplines must take a sequence of four
core courses. Three of these are joint (ANSO) courses. The sequences are:

(2) Elective Courses. Majors in Anthropology or Sociology must take five
elective courses from the course listings of their respective disciplines
or from the joint ANSO listings. Two of the courses chosen must be at the
300 level or above. In close consultation with their departmental advisers,
students may take some selected courses from other disciplines to fulfill
major requirements in either Anthropology or Sociology.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
AREA STUDIES CONCENTRATION
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who wish to combine a major in Anthropology or Sociology with an
Area Studies concentration are encouraged to do so. Courses taken to satisfy
an Area Studies requirement may be counted toward the major with prior approval
of a student's departmental adviser. The only exception to this rule is the
Area Studies senior seminar, which cannot ordinarily be counted toward the
Anthropology or Sociology degree.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
LANGUAGE STUDY, STUDY ABROAD, AND WINTER STUDY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Departmental advisers will help interested students integrate a major with
study abroad, foreign language study, or field research during the Winter
Study Period. The department encourages Williams students to take advantage
of established foreign study programs in Egypt, Japan, India, Hong Kong,
and various European and African countries. Because some foreign study programs
do not offer courses that can be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociology
degrees, however, sophomores planning to study abroad in junior year must
consult with the departmental adviser before declaring a major.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Honors and Highest Honors are normally awarded for the completion of a year-long
research project that has resulted in an original thesis of high quality.
Students wishing to write an Honors Thesis should engage a member of the
department faculty as a Thesis Advisor as soon as possible and must submit
a proposal for the thesis for department approval no later than preregistration
in the Spring of the junior year. If the proposal is approved, they will
be permitted to register for Anthropology and Sociology 493-W031-494, during
which they will write and defend a thesis. If their overall work in the major
continues to be of high quality and the thesis is deemed of a similar quality,
they may be awarded Honors or Highest Honors in Anthropology or Sociology.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Art History Route: The history of art is different from other historical
disciplines in that it is founded on direct visual confrontation with objects
that are both concretely present and yet documents of the past. We concentrate
on architecture, painting, sculpture-the richest visual expressions of culture.
Since works of art embody human experience, we use the work of all other
disciplines to understand them, such as social history, perceptual psychology,
engineering, psychoanalysis, and archaeology. Because of its concentration
on the visual experience, the art history major increases one's ability to
observe and to use those observations as the basis for critical thought.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
ArtH 101-102 introduces students to a series of critical studies of important
works selected from the history of western art from antiquity to the present.
The critical approach of the introductory course is maintained in all further
courses, especially by assigned study of original works in the Williams College
Museum of Art, Chapin Library, and the Clark Art Institute.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An introductory studio course, ArtS 100, in which no artistic talent or prior
experience are assumed, provides vital training in what is a visual as well
as a verbal discipline. The requirement of a course in non-western art expands
majors' geographic as well as cultural horizons, and the requirement of two
courses in art from periods prior to 1800 provides a necessary concentration
on earlier moments in culture. (As the contemporary architect, Philip Johnson,
said, "You cannot not know history"). The junior course (ArtH 301) develops
awareness of the theoretical implications, as well as the possibilities and
limitations of different art-historical methods. The requirement of a seminar
or graduate course in the senior year enables students to apply that knowledge
of methodology to their most specialized work in the art history route.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Art Studio Route: The studio division of the Art major has been structured
to foster the development of a critical understanding of making art; to support
creative interests and to develop students' perceptions and imaginations
as they investigate a variety of visual media. Drawing I, ArtS 100 or ArtS
103, serve as an introduction to the basic drawing and design principles
which establish the foundation for the development of visual expression.
ArtH 101-102, an introduction to the history of western art, provides part
of the necessary background in the critical analysis of art. The 200-level
ArtS courses provide opportunities to learn the elements of some of the principal
visual arts media: architecture, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture,
and video. These courses combine technical foundations in the medium with
analysis of the interrelation of visual form and content. The 300- and 400-level
courses place a greater emphasis on the application of appropriate visual
skills and strategies to particular thematic concerns, and to the development
of the student's individual vision. All studio art seniors exhibit their
work in the Williams College Museum of Art as a part of the requirements
for the major.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Production requirements for the major: All art studio majors are required
to earn four production credits by participating in relevant studio activities.
These credits should be planned in consultation with a studio faculty advisor.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Contract Major in Architecture
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In consultation with members of the architecture advisory committee, students
may develop a contract major in architecture. Courses should normally be
selected from ArtS and ArtH courses focused on architecture. Interested students
must meet with a member of the architecture advisory committee early in the
second semester of the sophomore year. Students proposing a contract major
should have completed or be enrolled in ArtH 101-102 and ArtS 100. Each contract
major must be approved by the C.E.P.

COURSE NUMBERS
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
First Digit
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The introductory courses in both art history and studio have 100-level numbers
and are prerequisites for most other courses in the department. The distinction
between 200- and 300-level offerings is either one of difficulty or of the
sequence in which material is best taken. Also, lecture courses with no
prerequisite have a 100- or 200-level number. The 400-level seminars and
tutorials are intended for advanced students, usually senior majors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Middle Digit
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Art History (ArtH)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Middle digit distinguishes courses according to geographical area, or time
span covered. 0 = general; 1 = Ancient; 2 = Medieval; 3 = fifteenth, sixteenth
century; 4 = seventeenth, eighteenth century; 5 = nineteenth century; 6 =
twentieth century; 7 = Asian; 8 = African; 9 = independents, honors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Art Studio (ArtS)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Middle digit distinguishes introductory and general courses from those
specialized in different media and arts. 0 = introductory; 1 = general; 2
= architecture; 3 = drawing; 4 = painting; 5 = photography; 6 = printmaking;
7 = sculpture; 8 = video; 9 = independents, honors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ART
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who wish to become candidates for the degree with honors must show
prior evidence of superior performance in the major as well as research
capabilities to carry out the proposed project.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Art History:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order for a project to be considered, the candidate 1) must have arranged
for an advisor, and (in consultation with the advisor) a second reader to
supervise and evaluate the project 2) should normally have had one course
with the advisor. In addition, the topic must be within the advisor's areas
of competence and should normally be related to course work which the student
has done previously. In the case of an interdisciplinary proposal, the second
reader should normally come from the other discipline.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The student submits a 2-page proposal including a statement about the preparation
for the project, a description of the topic and a general bibliography. Following
approval by the faculty advisor and second reader, this proposal is reviewed
by the entire art faculty, who have the option to request revisions and to
refuse the proposal. Students should keep in mind that a thesis in art history
is not necessary for admission to graduate study.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is the responsibility of the candidate to select one of the following
routes and to meet all deadlines. Students who are not making satisfactory
progress on their research and writing will not be allowed to continue with
the thesis. The completion of the requirements, however, will not guarantee
a degree with honors. The degree with honors will be awarded for projects
demonstrating a high degree of scholarly achievement and self- motivation.
All proposals must be submitted according to the guidelines set out below.
The timetable for submission of work, including specific dates, is available
in the Art Department office.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Students may select one of the following options.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
1) Full Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during both
semesters and WSP of the senior year (students should register for ArtH
493-W031-494). The thesis topic, advisor and second reader must be determined
by April 15 of junior year. Students who are on overseas programs junior
year are advised to make arrangements prior to their departure, but they
may submit a final proposal two weeks before the fall semester of senior
year if they have made the necessary arrangements. After the thesis is submitted,
the candidate for honors shall present an oral defense before faculty and
peers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
2) Half-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during fall
term and winter study or during winter study and spring term (Students should
register for ArtH 493-W031 or W031-ArtH 494). For students who choose to
complete the mini-thesis in the Fall, proposals must be submitted by April
15 of the junior year. For those planning to complete the mini-thesis in
the Spring, proposals must be submitted by November 1.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A student's project is judged by two members of the department, the advisor
and second reader; in the case of an interdisciplinary project, a member
of the art department and a member of the other relevant department or program
function as advisor and second reader. In rare cases, a third reader may
be appointed by the department at the request of the advisor or second reader.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All routes require that one course and one WSP, in addition to the ten required
courses for the major, be dedicated to the honors project.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Art Studio:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Art studio division of the Art Department offers a specialization route
toward departmental honors. This route, which requires the completion of
a substantial body of independently produced visual work, consists of two
courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study. The first of
these must be a WSP 033 in the senior year, followed by ArtS 418T Senior
Tutorials.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the spring of their junior year, students should consult with a prospective
faculty advisor and declare their intent to pursue the degree with honors
to the Department Chair. In September of the student's senior year, the student
will meet with his/her faculty advisor to discuss the writing of the required
honors prospectus. The prospectus should present a coherent proposal, indicating
the range of the thesis, the questions to be investigated, the media which
will be utilized, and a selected bibliography. Two weeks before WSP registration,
in the fall of the student's senior year, three copies of this prospectus
should be submitted: one to the faculty advisor, the second to the faculty
member teaching ArtS 418T, and the third to the Department Chair. The studio
faculty will review the prospectuses and the Department Chair will inform
students of their decisions. Should a student's honors prospectus be approved,
the student must enroll in WSP 033 and devote the winter study period to
realizing a substantial amount of work toward the project. Members of the
studio faculty will review this work in February and determine whether progress
is sufficiently substantial to allow a student to continue to pursue the
degree with honors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be considered for Honors a student must successfully complete all requirements
for the major. Each Honors candidate will be expected to have demonstrated
the ability to work independently and the understanding of what is required
to develop a body of work that investigates a thesis. The project will culminate
in a presentation agreed upon by the student, the faculty adviser, and the
faculty tutor teaching ArtS 418T. All candidates will be required to present
the department with a set of no fewer than twenty slides that document the
work completed during the project. This documentation will be accompanied
by a written description of the project.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The awarding of Honors will be decided by the studio faculty of the department,
on the recommendation of the student's adviser and the faculty member teaching
ArtS 418T, based on performance in the two related courses. Highest Honors
are normally awarded only to students whose performance in both the honors
program and other courses in the major has been exceptional.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
GRADUATE COURSES IN ART HISTORY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts in Art History
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The degree is normally awarded upon successful completion of two years of
resident graduate study. To earn the degree the student must earn a grade
of at least B- in each of ten courses, at least six of which must be graduate
seminars (including ArtH 504), and fulfill the language requirement in the
manner described below. In special circumstances credit may be given for
up to two courses of graduate work satisfactorily completed elsewhere.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to completing the required courses, students must participate
in a group study trip to Europe during Winter Study Period in the first year,
complete a qualifying paper in January of the second year, and pass an oral
exam or present a shortened version of the qualifying paper in the graduate
symposium (held in late May) at the end of the second year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Senior art majors may enroll in graduate seminars, space permitting, with
the permission of the instructor.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
LANGUAGE COURSES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reading proficiency in two European languages is required for the M.A. degree
in art history at Williams, and provision for attainment of this qualification
is an integral part of the program of study. Of these two, German is required,
and French is recommended. Elementary and intermediate undergraduate courses
offered by the language departments are open to graduate students, and the
Graduate Program offers advanced, one-semester courses in French and German
art-history readings. A student who begins elementary language study after
enrollment in the Program should expect to take a sequence of courses. Details
may be obtained from the Graduate Program Office. Entering students with
some previous language background will be asked to take a standard reading
examination for purposes of placement. A score of 500 is required for admission
to the advanced course. Students with scores below 500 will be enrolled in
elementary language courses. Students should aim to complete all language
work no later than the end of the third semester.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To satisfy the requirement in each of the two required languages, a student
must (a) score 700 or better on the CEEB reading examination upon enrollment
in the program or, (b) complete satisfactorily (B- or better) and punctually
all assignments and tests in the advanced courses. The same standards and
expectations apply to language courses as to other courses and seminars.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Second-year students who have successfully completed German 501-502 and have
independently developed their German language skills during the summer may,
before the commencement of their third semester of study, arrange to take
a two-hour translation examination administered by the Graduate Program.
Students who pass the examination are exempted from German 509.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If appropriate to his or her course of study, a student may petition to
substitute another language for French. Instruction in Spanish, Russian,
Latin, and Greek is regularly offered in the undergraduate curriculum, whereas
independent arrangements must be made for Italian, Dutch, and other languages.

The Department of Asian Studies offers courses in English in the field of
Asian Studies as well as courses in Japanese language, Chinese language,
and Chinese literature. Three distinct majors are offered: a major in Chinese;
a major in Japanese; and an interdisciplinary Asian Studies major which allows
students to choose from a wide range of courses in the anthropology, art,
economy, history, languages, literatures, music, politics, religion, and
sociology of China, Japan, and other Asian countries. Students with questions
about the Asian Studies majors or about Asian Studies course offerings should

Students intending to major in Asian Studies are encouraged to study in Asia
during one or both semesters of their junior year. Williams sponsors study
abroad programs in China and Japan. Opportunities to study in India, Indonesia,
Korea, Thailand, and other Asian countries are also available. Prospective
Asian Studies majors who are planning to study abroad should discuss their
plans with their advisor as far in advance as possible. Up to eight courses
taken overseas can count toward graduation, and up to four courses taken
overseas may be counted toward the major.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students interested in writing an honors thesis in Asian Studies should submit
a proposal to the department chair when they register for courses in the
spring of their junior year. The proposal should include a statement of the
topic, a general description of the types of materials available for study
and how the study will be carried out, and the name of the faculty member
who will serve as advisor. Admission to the honors thesis program will normally
be limited to students who have maintained at least a B+ average in their
Asian Studies courses.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students admitted to the program should register for ASST 493, ASST W031
and ASST 494. They will be expected to turn in the final draft of their thesis
shortly after spring break and to discuss their results formally with their
faculty graders. Their final grades in the three courses listed above and
the award of Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors will be determined by the
quality of the thesis and the student's performance in the oral defense.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE ASIAN STUDIES ENDOWMENT
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Linen summer grants for study abroad, the Linen visiting professorships,
and several other programmatic activities in the department are supported
by an endowment for Asian Studies established by family and friends in memory
of James A. Linen III, Class of 1934, Trustee of the College from 1948 to
1953 and from 1963 to 1982.
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">
  COURSES IN CHINESE
</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department regularly offers four levels of instruction in Modern Chinese
(Mandarin), designed to enable the student to become proficient in aural
comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing, as well as an introductory
course in Classical Chinese. The course numbering system for Chinese is
sequential. Students move from Chinese 101-102 to 201, 202, 301, 302, 401,
and 402. Independent study (Chinese 497, 498) may be offered depending on
student needs and available resources. Those students entering with previous
proficiency in Chinese should see Professor Silber concerning placement.
The Department also offers courses on Chinese literature in translation for
those students who have no knowledge of the language but who wish to become
acquainted with the major achievements in Chinese literary and intellectual
history. Students having questions concerning these courses should also see
Professor Silber. For the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses
in Chinese are considered Division I.
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">
  COURSES IN JAPANESE
</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department regularly offers four levels of language instruction in Modern
Japanese, designed to enable the student to become proficient in aural

Chair, Professor JAY M. PASACHOFF
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Professors: KWITTER, PASACHOFF. Observatory Supervisor/Instructor: MARTIN.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why is the sky dark at night? What are those mysterious twinkling lights
that dot the nighttime sky? What is Earth's place in the universe? Astronomy
is the science that asks and tries to answer questions like these. We have
come a long way toward understanding what makes the sky appear as it does
and how the universe is fashioned. The Astronomy Department offers courses
for anyone who is interested in learning about the universe, and who would
like to be able to follow new astronomical discoveries as they are made.
All courses in Astronomy satisfy the Division III requirement. The Astrophysics
major, administered jointly with the Physics Department, and the Astronomy
major, are described below.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The beginning astronomy courses are offered on two levels. Astronomy 101,
102, 104, and 330-type courses are intended primarily for non-science majors,
and have no prerequisite. Astronomy 111 is designed for students with some
exposure to or interest in physics. It has a prerequisite of one year of
high school physics or permission of the instructor, and a corequisite of
Mathematics 103 or equivalent background in the calculus.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most of the astronomy courses take advantage of our observational and
computational facilities: a 24" computer-controlled telescope with sensitive
electronic detectors, and our own network of computer workstations for image
processing. The Astronomy Department homepage can be accessed on the World
Wide Web at http://www.williams.edu/Astronomy.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ASTRONOMY MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Astronomy major is designed for students with an interest in learning
about many aspects of modern astronomy, but who do not intend to pursue it
in graduate school. It is also appropriate as a second major for students
concentrating in another field. The Astronomy major emphasizes understanding
the observed properties of the physical systems that comprise the known universe,
from the Sun and solar system, to the evolution of stars and star clusters,
to the Milky Way Galaxy, to external galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Because
some knowledge of physics and calculus is necessary to understand many
astronomical phenomena, the Astronomy major requires the first two semesters
each of the physics and calculus that are also required of Physics majors
and Astrophysics majors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are several possible routes through the Astronomy major, depending
on preparation and interest. Students considering a major in Astronomy should
consult with members of the department early and often. A first-year student,
unsure about choosing between Astronomy and Astrophysics, may wish to take
not only Astronomy 111 but also Physics 131 or 141 and Math 104 (if necessary)
in the fall. Students who might place out of physics courses should read
the section on placement under Physics.

The total number of courses required for the Astronomy major is nine. Students
entering with Advanced Placement in physics and/or math may obtain credit

elsewhere. There are some aspects of astronomy that are closely related to
chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of this, certain advanced courses
in those departments can be accepted for credit toward the Astronomy major.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTRONOMY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The honors degree in Astronomy will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis
presenting the results of an original observational, experimental, or theoretical
investigation carried out by the student under the direction of a faculty
member in Astronomy. There are no specific grade requirements (other than
College-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for entry
into the thesis research program; however, a student wishing to do a thesis
should have demonstrated both ability and motivation for independent work
in previous courses and in any earlier research involvement. Students doing
theses will normally choose a topic and an adviser early in the second semester
of their junior year. During the senior year, those students whose proposals
have been approved will elect two courses and a Winter Study Project in addition
to the minimum requirements for the major. Preparation for the thesis will
occupy at least one course (Astronomy 493) and the Winter Study Project
(Astronomy 031). At the end of the Winter Study Period, the department will
decide, in consultation with each student, whether to admit that student
to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and an oral presentation to faculty
and fellow students are required. The degree with honors will be awarded
to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with highest
honors will be awarded to those who fulfill the requirements with unusually
high distinction.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The department will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses
devoted to thesis research within the general guidelines of two courses and
a Winter Study Project over and above the minimum major requirements and
the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students with
advanced standing and/or summer research experience. Students considering
unusual requests are urged to consult with potential advisers or the department
chair as early as possible.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Astrophysics major is designed for students who plan graduate study in
astronomy, astrophysics, or a closely related field, and also can be elected
by those interested in a wide variety of careers. This major emphasizes the
description of the universe and its constituents in terms of physical processes.
Potential Astrophysics majors should consult early with members of the Astronomy
and Physics departments to determine their most appropriate route to and
through the major. An essential ingredient in such students' undergraduate
training is experience in physics and mathematics. Therefore, the major normally
will begin in the first year a student is at Williams with Physics 131 or
141 and Math 104 in the fall, and continue with Physics 142 and Math 105
in the spring. Students with very good background placing them out of Physics
142 and out of Math 104 may choose to take Physics 201 and Math 105 instead.
Astronomy 111 will therefore normally be taken in the fall of the sophomore
year; however, students may also take it in the fall of their first year
at Williams, along with physics and math. Students who might place out of
physics courses should read the section on placement under Physics. Students
who place out of Physics 131 or 141 into Physics 142 should particularly
consider taking Astronomy 111 in the fall of their first year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to the major courses described below, other courses in geosciences,
mathematics, and computer science may also be appropriate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Biochemistry and molecular biology are dynamic fields which lie at the forefront
of science. They have provided important insights and advances in the elucidation
of the relationship between the structure and function of proteins, the molecules
and cells of the immune system, enzyme structure and action, membrane assembly
and structure, DNA and RNA structure, the nature of the genetic code, and
the molecular basis of gene regulation. Recombinant DNA and other biotechnologies
have provided new and powerful tools which have exciting applications. Current
applications range from the diagnosis and treatment of disease to enzyme
chemistry, developmental biology, and the engineering of new crop plants.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program is designed to provide students
with an opportunity to explore living systems in molecular terms. Biochemistry
and molecular biology are at the interface between the chemical and biological
methods of looking at nature, therefore, the Program draws heavily from these
disciplines. While chemistry is concerned with the relationship between molecular
structure and reactions, and biology focuses on cells and organisms, biochemistry
and molecular biology probe the details of the structures and interactions
of molecules in living systems in order to provide the foundation for a better
understanding of biological molecules both individually and as members of
more complex structures.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
PROGRAM
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology can be very diverse,
a common set of chemical and biological principles underlie the more advanced
topics. With this in mind, the Program has been structured to provide the
necessary background in chemistry and biology and the opportunity to study
the many facets of the modern areas of the biochemical sciences. Students
interested in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program should plan
their course selection carefully. Since it is expected that Biochemistry
321 and 322 would be taken in the junior year, students are advised to take
the prerequisites for those courses in both chemistry and biology during
their first two years at Williams. While the Program is open to all students,
it is expected that it will appeal primarily to majors in biology and chemistry
because of the number of courses required in those fields. In addition to
taking the required courses, students planning to complete the Biochemistry
and Molecular Biology Program are strongly encouraged to elect courses in
mathematics and physics.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE FOLLOWING INTERDEPARTMENTAL SEQUENCE COURSES SERVE AS THE CORE OF THE
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROGRAM
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Biochemistry 321 and 322 provide a comprehensive introduction to biochemistry.
These courses taken in conjunction with Biology 202 Genetics and Biology
306 Advanced Molecular Genetics provide a thorough background in essentially
all of the areas of modern biochemistry and molecular biology. The senior
seminar, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 406 Topics in Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology, is designed to apply the background obtained in these
courses to a critical reading of the literature.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To complete the concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a student

The Biology curriculum has been designed to provide students a broad base
for understanding principles governing life processes at all levels, from
biochemistry and cell biology to physiology to environmental biology and
behavior. Courses emphasize fundamentals common to all subdisciplines including
the coupling of structure to function, the transfer of energy in living systems,
communication, and the molding of diversity by the evolutionary process.
In upper-level courses and in independent and Honors research, students have
the opportunity to investigate areas at the frontiers of modern biology.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although the biology major is specifically designed to provide a balanced
curriculum in the broader context of the liberal arts, it is also excellent
preparation for graduate studies in medicine and the life sciences.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to make the major accessible to students with diverse interests,
required courses are kept to a minimum. The Biology major is satisfied by
nine courses, as follows:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Biology 101 The Cell
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Biology 102 The Organism
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Biology 202 Genetics
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Any two 300-level courses, one of which must have a laboratory associated
with it.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Any one 400-level course.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Any other three courses or any other two courses and Chemistry 201-202.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
NOTE: Independent study courses and AMS 311 (Same as Biology 231) do not
fulfill the 300-level course requirement. Both WIOX 215, Biology: Ecology
of Flowering Plants and WIOX 216, Biology: Evolution, in the Williams Oxford
Program qualify for major credit. BIMO 406 satisfies the 400-level requirement;
however, students electing this option must take nine courses in addition
to BIMO 406 in order to satisfy major requirements. NSCI 401 does not satisfy
the 400-level requirement in the major.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Distribution Requirement
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to ensure that majors broaden their knowledge of biology, one of
the elective courses for the major must include a course covering biological
processes at levels of organization above the cell. Courses that satisfy
this distribution requirement are indicated in the individual course description.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
COURSE SELECTION AND PLACEMENT
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is preferable for students who plan to major in biology, or think they
may be interested in doing so, to take Biology 101, 102 during their first
year at Williams. It is also possible to begin the biology major during the
sophomore year, although students should understand that it may require taking
several semesters with two or more biology courses.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students interested in biology, whether or not they intend to major in it,
are encouraged to take Biology 101, 102. It is also possible, with permission
of the department, to take Biology 203 Ecology and Biology 204 Animal Behavior
without prerequisite. Other biology courses designed specifically for students
who do not intend to take additional upper level courses in biology include
Biology 132 Human Biology and Social Issues and Biology 134 The Tropics:
Biology and Social Issues. Both of these courses satisfy the Division III
distribution requirement; in addition, Biology 134 satisfies the Peoples
and Cultures distribution requirement.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Beginning students should normally enroll in Biology 101 and 102. Students
with unusually strong backgrounds in biology, such as those with outstanding
performance on the College Board Biology Advanced Placement Test, may be
permitted to elect a sophomore-level course in lieu of Biology 101 and/or
Biology 102 upon successful completion of a departmental qualifying exam.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students interested in attending graduate school in biology are advised to
take organic chemistry (Chemistry 201-202).
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN BIOLOGY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to be recommended for the degree with Honors, a biology major is
normally expected to have completed the equivalent of two semesters and a
Winter Study (031) of independent research culminating in a thesis which
demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature.
Although the presentation of a thesis, and associated oral presentation in
the fall and poster defense in the spring, are required for consideration
for a degree with honors, their completion should not be interpreted as a
guarantee of a degree with Honors. The principal considerations in admitting
a student to the program of independent Honors research will be mastery of
fundamental material and skills, ability to pursue independent study
successfully, and demonstrated student interest and motivation. Students
interested in participating in the Honors program should consult with the
Department prior to spring break; approval must be received before spring
registration in the junior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The minimum course requirements for a degree with Honors in Biology are Biology
101, Biology 102, Biology 202, two 300-level biology courses (one of which
must have a laboratory associated with it), one 400-level biology course,
Biology 493, Biology 494, WSP 031, and any other two courses in biology (or
any other one course and Chemistry 201-202).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to the normal Honors route, which includes two semesters (Biology
493-494) and a Winter Study of research (WSP 031) during senior year, students
have the option, subject to the approval of their thesis advisor, to begin

MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through a variety of individual courses and sequential programs, the Department
provides an opportunity for students to explore the nature and significance
of chemistry, an area of important achievement in our quest for knowledge
about ourselves and the world around us. The student is able to become aware
of the special viewpoint of chemists, the general nature of chemical
investigation, some of the important results, how these results are expressed,
and something of their significance within the fields of science and in the
area of human endeavor as a whole.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A major in chemistry can be achieved in several ways, preferably beginning
in the student's first year at Williams, but also beginning in the sophomore
year. Building on a foundation in general chemistry, organic chemistry, and
physical chemistry, a student elects additional advanced courses to complete
a major that is consistent with his or her background in other sciences,
interests, and goals. A student's program might emphasize biochemistry, organic
chemistry, or physical chemistry, with additional courses available in analytical
chemistry and inorganic chemistry. Students considering a major in chemistry
should consult with a member of the Department as early as possible in order
to plan a program which best suits their interests and abilities and which
makes full use of their previous preparation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Usually the requirements for the major are fulfilled by completing "Required
Courses" and the appropriate number of "Elective Courses." Starting at the
200 level, at least five of the courses taken must have a laboratory component.
In addition, the Department has a number of "Independent Research Courses"
which, while they do not count toward completion of the major, provide a
unique opportunity to pursue an independent research project under the direction
of a faculty member.

aBased on an outstanding performance on the College Board Chemistry Advanced
Placement Test, and having consulted with the chair, a first-year student
may gain credit toward the major for 101, 102 and elect Chemistry 201-202
or 301, 302 directly.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
bWhile the organic chemistry courses are normally elected before the physical
chemistry courses, the order may be reversed. The organic chemistry courses
and the physical chemistry courses may also be elected concurrently.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
cChemistry 301 is a prerequisite for Chemistry 302. Chemistry 301, 302 are
strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate study in chemistry.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
dChemistry 301, 310 are strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate
study in biochemistry.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
eThe Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight
semester chemistry courses plus two approved courses from among the following:
Biology 101, 102; Computer Science 134; Mathematics 103, 104, 105; Physics
131, 132; or any courses in these departments for which the approved courses
are prerequisites. No more than two advanced-level organic courses may be
counted toward completion of the major.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Completion of any one of the advanced-level elective courses will satisfy
the College requirement that a student complete a major seminar.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with
their interests, the following groupings of electives and faculty advisors
are suggested. However, a case can be made for selecting courses from the
different groups.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Biochemistry: Chemistry 303, Chemistry 308, Chemistry 310, Chemistry 311,
Chemistry 314T, Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322 (Students interested in biochemistry
should consult with Mr. Kaplan, Mr. Lovett, or Ms. Weiss.)<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 303, Chemistry 310, Chemistry 311, Chemistry
312T, Chemistry 313 (Students interested in organic chemistry should consult
with Mr. Smith, Mr. Markgraf, or Mr. Richardson.) <BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 304, Chemistry 305, Chemistry
313, Chemistry 314T, Chemistry 401 (Students interested in physical chemistry
should consult with Mr. Chang, Ms. Koehler, Mr. Peacock-Lopez, or Mr. Thoman.
Students interested in inorganic chemistry should consult with Mr. Schofield
or Ms. Park.)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in
chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, environmental science, medicine,
and the medical sciences. The major can also be useful to those whose later
professional or business careers may be related to chemical materials or
processes. While any accepted route through the major would permit a student
to proceed to graduate study in chemistry, three electives should be considered
a minimum, and the particular importance of Chemistry 301, 302, and 304 as
preparation for advanced study should be noted. In addition, at least a semester
of research and courses in computer science are strongly recommended.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary
school foundation in chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory
course of a general nature or they may elect semester courses designed for
nonmajors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the distribution requirement.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a
professional body of academic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S.
suggests the following courses for someone considering graduate study or
work in chemistry or a related area. Students completing these courses are
designated Certified A.C.S. Majors: 101, 102 (103-104), 201-202, 301, 302,
304, 305, 493-494, and at least two courses from 303, 311, 321, 322, 401.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult
the general statement under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in the Courses
of Instruction.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Degree with Honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity
to undertake an independent research project under the supervision of a faculty
member, and to report on the nature of the work in two short oral presentations
and in a written thesis.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Chemistry majors who are candidates for the Degree with Honors take the following
in addition to a major listed above:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent
research are mastery of fundamental materials and skills, ability to pursue
independent study successfully, and demonstrated student interest and motivation.
In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a Degree with Honors,
a student must have a B- average in all chemistry courses or the permission
of the chair. At the end of the first semester, the Department reviews the
student's progress and determines whether the student is a candidate for
a Degree with Honors. The designation of a Degree with Honors in Chemistry
or a Degree with Highest Honors in Chemistry is based primarily on a departmental
evaluation of the accomplishments in these courses and on the quality of
the thesis. Completion of the research project in a satisfactory manner and
preparation of a well-written thesis usually results in a Degree with Honors.
In cases where a student has demonstrated unusual commitment and initiative
resulting in an outstanding thesis based on original experimental results,
combined with a strong record in all of his or her chemistry courses, the
Department awards a Degree with Highest Honors in Chemistry.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry
involving college-level prerequisites should do so in person with a member
of the Chemistry Department staff. Registration should take place by appointment
during the spring semester prior to the academic year in which courses are
to be taken. Students are requested to have with them transcripts of the
relevant previous college work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The course offerings in Classics enable students to explore the ancient Greek,
Roman, and Greco-Roman worlds from various perspectives: art, archaeology,
philosophy, religion, and especially literature and history. Courses are
of two types: language (Greek and Latin) and translation (Classical
Civilization). The 100-level language courses are intensive introductions
to Greek and Latin grammar; the 200-level language courses combine comprehensive
grammar review with readings from Greek or Latin texts of pivotal historical
periods; the 400-level language courses explore in depth selected authors
or topics and the methods of analysis appropriate to each of them. Courses
in which texts are read in translation provide both introductory surveys
and opportunities for more specialized study of the ancient Greco-Roman world
from earliest historical times through late antiquity.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Majors and prospective majors are encouraged to consult with the department's
faculty to ensure a well-balanced and comprehensive selection of Classics
courses appropriate to their individual interests. A course or courses in
ancient history are strongly recommended. Majors may also benefit from advice
on courses offered in other departments which would complement their particular
interests in Classics. A reading knowledge of French, German, and Italian
is useful for any study in Classics and is required in at least two of these
modern languages by graduate programs in Classics, Ancient History, Classical
Art and Archaeology, and Medieval Studies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department offers two routes to the major: Classics and Classical
Civilization.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Classics: 1) Six courses in Greek and/or Latin, with at least two 400-level
courses in one language. 2) Three additional courses, elected from the offerings
in Greek, Latin, or Classical Civilization or from approved courses in other
departments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Classical Civilization: 1) Either Classics 101 or 103, and either Classics
216 or 218. 2) Three additional courses from the offerings in Classical
Civilization or from approved courses in other departments. 3) Three courses
in Greek or Latin with at least one at the 400 level, or four courses in
Latin at any level. 4) A senior independent study is normally required to
complete the Classical Civilization major. Several of the courses elected,
including the independent study, should relate to each other in such a way
as to reflect a concentration on a particular genre, period, or problem of
Greek and Roman civilization, including topics in ancient art and archaeology,
religion in the Greco-Roman world, and ancient philosophy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to the courses in Classical Civilization, appropriate courses
from other departments or from approved study abroad programs may be elected
for the major. Examples of such courses, which may vary from year to year,
are Philosophy 221 (Ancient Philosophy), Art History 213 (Greek Art &amp;
Myth), and appropriate courses at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical
Studies in Rome or at another approved overseas program.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Senior Colloquium: In lieu of a semester-long major seminar, majors will
participate in the Senior Colloquium, a student-faculty discussion group
that meets twice each semester during the senior year. The meetings focus
on critical readings in Classics, often in conjunction with a guest lecturer's
visit.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CLASSICS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who wish to be considered for the degree with honors will normally
present a thesis or pursue appropriate independent study in the fall and
Winter Study of their senior year. This thesis or independent study offers
students an opportunity to work in depth on a topic of their choosing and
to apply and develop the techniques and critical methods with which they
have become acquainted during their regular course work. It may also include
relevant work with members of other departments. In order to write a thesis,
students normally must have a minimum GPA of 3.3 in their major courses and
must submit a thesis proposal before the end of the spring semester of their
junior year that earns departmental approval. To be awarded the degree with
honors in Classics, the student is required to have taken a minimum of ten
semester courses in the department (not including the thesis or independent
study) and to have demonstrated original or superior ability in studies in
the field both through course work and through the thesis or equivalent
independent study.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Language Courses: The numbering of these courses through the 200 level reflects
the prerequisites involved; the only prerequisite for any 400-level course
is Greek 201 or Latin 202, or equivalent language preparation. The numbering
of the 400-level courses partially reflects the order in which they are offered
over a two-year period for Greek and a three-year period for Latin. It also
indicates a good order in which to take the 400-level courses but not an
essential order, and individual students may enter the sequence at any point.
While not every student will take every course, the rotation of 400-level
courses is arranged to permit exposure, in a three-to-four-year period, to
most of the important periods and genres of classical studies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Classical Civilization Courses: The numbering of these courses often suggests
a recommended but rarely necessary sequence of study within a given area
of classical studies. Most of the translation courses do not assume prior
experience in Classics or a cross-listed field.

  CONTRACT MAJOR
</H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Contract Major Advisor: PETER D. GRUDIN<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students with the talent and energy for working independently and with the
strong support of two faculty advisors may undertake a contract major: a
coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by a regularly
offered major. Such a major must be in an area suitable to the talents of
the faculty in residence and cannot consist of minor modifications to an
existing major. A contract major also must conform to the structure and have
the coherence of a departmental or program major-i.e., it must embody a
disciplined cumulative study that moves from an elementary to an advanced
level and culminates in a synthesis similar to a senior major course. Hence
a contract major usually consists of a program of existing courses sometimes
supplemented by courses of independent study and the senior course.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The process of constructing a proposal for a contract major is both interesting
and demanding. As part of that process, students should consider carefully
the advantage of working within existing majors or programs, taking note
of the considerable intellectual pleasures involved in sharing similar
educational experiences with other students working within the same field.
Students might also consider whether their interests could be met by completing
a regular major and coordinate program, or a double major, or simply by working
outside a major field in courses of special interest. Because the contract
major represents an exceptional opportunity provided for students whose interests
cannot be met through existing departmental and interdepartmental majors
and programs, it cannot be pursued in conjunction with another major.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who wish to explore or propose a contract major should consult with
the Contract Major Advisor and with potential faculty sponsors as early as
possible in the fall semester of the sophomore year, and then-during the
sophomore year-follow these procedures:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
1) The student must initiate discussion with at least two members of the
Faculty from differing departments who expect to be in residence during the
student's senior year and who are willing to endorse the contract major and
undertake a central role in supervising its implementation, criticism,
evaluation, and ultimate validation. Since in essence faculty sponsors substitute
for the student's major department, they are expected to play an important
role in the contract major.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The student must develop, in conjunction with the faculty sponsors, a written
proposal (forms and guidelines are available in the Dean's Office) which
should contain:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
a) a description of the proposed major area of study and an explanation of
the reasons for proposing the contract major. A sound and persuasive rationale
for the major is crucial for obtaining approval from the Committee on Educational
Policy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
b) a list of all courses in the proposed major and an explanation for each
course choice. A minimum of nine semester courses, one of which must be
designated the senior major course (and taken during the senior year), must
be completed for a contract major. Normal rules governing course grades and
grade point average apply for entry into and continuation in a contract major.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
c) a list of other courses taken or anticipated to meet College distribution
and degree requirements, including grades received in courses already completed.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
2) By mid-January, the student must meet with the Contract Major Advisor
to discuss and further develop the proposal.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
3) By the first day of spring semester classes, the student must submit a
complete draft of the proposal to the Contract Major Advisor for feedback.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
4) By the end of the fourth week of the spring semester, the student must
submit the final proposal to the Contract Major Advisor. By this date also,
the faculty sponsors must submit the endorsement and proposal forms to the
Contract Major Advisor. If the student is essentially proposing to transform
an existing coordinate program (e.g. Afro-American Studies, area studies
programs, Environmental Studies, Women's and Gender Studies, etc.), into
a contract major, the chair of that program should also submit to the Contract
Major Advisor a statement attesting to the validity of the proposal. These
letters must be received by the Contract Major Advisor by the end of the
fourth week of the spring semester.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
5) The Contract Major Advisor then conveys the proposal, a copy of the student's
most recent academic progress report, the faculty sponsors' endorsement forms,
and recommendations regarding the feasibility and substance of the proposal,
for approval by the Committee on Educational Policy. The C.E.P., after
consultation with departments and programs substantially affected by a proposal,
will vote on each proposal individually and will report the decision to the
Contract Major Advisor, who will notify students and sponsors before the
spring registration deadline. If time necessary for C.E.P. review demands
it, the Contract Major Advisor may postpone notification to students and
permit them to register late without penalty. In making its decisions, the
C.E.P. considers the student's academic record, the coherence and feasibility
of the plan of study, and the degree of support expressed by the faculty
sponsors and, if appropriate, program chairs.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Subsequent changes in a contract major must be requested in writing by the
student and approved by the faculty sponsors as well as by the Contract Major
Advisor. Where there has been substantial alteration of the original program,
the Contract Major Advisor will forward the student's written request to
the C.E.P. for reconsideration.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THE CONTRACT MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The route to the degree with Honors in the contract major will normally be
a senior thesis requiring two semesters and a Winter Study of work. In special
circumstances a student may propose to substitute a one semester course or
a Winter Study course for one of his or her thesis courses and write a
minithesis. The contract major with Honors shall comprise a minimum of eleven
semester courses or ten semester courses plus one Winter Study. One semester
of independent study undertaken for the thesis may be allowed to fulfill
the requirement for a senior major course.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Faculty sponsors shall determine by the end of Winter Study whether the
student is to be admitted to Honors candidacy. If not admitted to Honors
candidacy, the student may elect not to continue further independent study.
If admitted to Honors candidacy, the student shall submit a written thesis
or minithesis to three Faculty readers, at least one of whom shall be a Faculty
sponsor and at least one of whom shall not be a Faculty sponsor. The outside
reader or readers shall be selected by the Contract Major Advisor in consultation
with the Faculty sponsors. There will be a one hour oral exam by the readers,
and they shall make a final decision regarding Honors.

  CRITICAL LANGUAGES (Div. I)
</H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Coordinator, JANE CANOVA<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Critical Languages program enables students to study foreign languages
not offered in regular courses at Williams. The languages currently available
are Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Korean, and Swahili. Each may be studied for one
year. The courses are not open to first-year students.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Critical Language Program is a self-instructional language program that
follows the principles of the National Association of Self-Instructional
Language Programs (NASILP). Students will be expected to work with a standard
language textbook and individual cassette tapes for roughly ten hours per
week, and to attend two hours of review per week with trained tutors. Midterm
and final exams will be conducted by language specialists from other
universities. Final grades will be determined by the outside examiners.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be eligible for a Critical Languages course, the student must:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
-demonstrate proven capability for independent work and previous success
in foreign language study,
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
-explain how study of the language will integrate with his or her major or
other academic interests,
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
-enlist a member of the Williams faculty as a sponsor,
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
-in some cases take a pre-test for placement,
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
-have at least a 3.00 Grade Point Average.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Interested students must meet with the program coordinator and obtain an
application for the desired course prior to the Spring break. Applications
are due in the Center for Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Cultures no
later than the first Monday after Spring break. The application must be completed
and approved before registering for the course. Because of the special
arrangements with tutors and examiners that must be made for each course,
students planning to register for the course must attend an organizational
meeting the first week of the fall semester.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students should note that Critical Languages courses are hyphenated, meaning
no credit is given for the first semester until the second semester is
successfully completed. Students must normally begin a course in the Fall
semester. Under no circumstances will the Critical Languages Program support
a petition to receive credit for the first semester of a year-long course
without the student having passed the second semester of that course. Critical
Languages cannot be taken Pass/Fail. Moreover, a Critical Studies course
will be scheduled only if and when a minimum of two students is accepted
into the course.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Chair, Professor WILLIAM J. LENHART
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Professors: BRUCE*, LENHART, MURTAGH. Associate Professor: BAILEY*. Assistant
Professor: DANYLUK. Visiting Assistant Professors: SACHS, BALAZS.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Computers play an enormously important role in our society. General purpose
computers are used widely in business and industry and found in an increasing
number of homes. Special purpose computers are found in everything from
automobile engines to microwave ovens. Understanding and exploiting the great
potential of computers is the goal of research in computer science. Among
the many fascinating research projects in progress in computer science today
are investigations of: ways to focus more computational power on a problem
through the simultaneous use of many processors in parallel; revolutionary
computer languages designed to simplify the process of constructing complex
programs for computers; the use of computer generated graphic images in the
arts and as a tool for visualization in the natural sciences; and the use
of digital methods in global communications. The Computer Science Department
at Williams seeks to provide students with an understanding of the principles
underlying computer science that will enable them to understand and participate
in these exciting developments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The department recognizes that students' interests in computer science will
vary widely. The department attempts to meet these varying interests through
1) its major; 2) a selection of courses intended primarily for those who
are interested in a brief introduction to computer science or who seek to
develop some specific expertise in computing for application in some other
discipline and 3) recommendations for possible sequences of courses for the
non-major who wants a more extensive introduction to computer science. These
offerings are discussed in detail below.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem
solving as well as the conceptual organization of computers and complex programs
running on them. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles of computer
science, building upon the mathematical and theoretical ideas underlying
these principles. The introductory and core courses build a broad and solid
base for understanding computer science. The more advanced courses allow
students to sample a variety of specialized areas of computer science including
graphics, artificial intelligence, computer networks, parallel processing,
compiler design, and operating systems. Independent study and honors work
provide opportunities for students to study and conduct research on topics
of special interest.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The major in Computer Science equips students to take advantage of a wide
variety of career opportunities. Thus the major can be used as a preparation
for a career in computing, for graduate school, or simply to provide an in-depth
study of computer science for the student whose future career will only
tangentially be related to computer science.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Required courses in Computer Science<BR>
A minimum of 8 courses is required in Computer Science, including the following:
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Introductory Courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Computer Science 134 Introduction to Computer Science
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Computer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Core Courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Computer Science 237 Computer Organization
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Computer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Computer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Computer Science 361 Theory of Computation
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Electives
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses
to at least 8) chosen from 300- or 400-level courses in Computer Science.
At least one of these must be a course designated as a PROJECT COURSE. Computer
Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and thesis
courses) will normally not be used to satisfy the elective requirements.
Students may petition the department to waive this restriction with good
reasons.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Required courses in Mathematics
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mathematics 151 Discrete Mathematics
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mathematics 211 Linear Algebra
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who take Computer Science 105, 108 or 109 may use that course as
one of the two electives required for the major in Computer Science. Those
who count Computer Science 109 toward the major must select an elective different
from Computer Science 371 (Computer Graphics) for their project course.
Similarly, students who count Computer Science 108 as an elective can not
select Computer Science 373 as their second elective. Note also that Computer
Science 105, 108 and 109 are not open to students who have already successfully
completed a Computer Science course numbered 134 or higher.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must normally have completed
Computer Science 136 as well as Mathematics 151 by the end of the sophomore
year. Math 211 must be completed by the end of the junior year. Students
are urged to have completed two of the four core courses (Computer Science
237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sophomore year and must normally
have completed at least three out of the four core courses by the end of
the junior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Satisfactory participation is required in the Computer Science Colloquium
by all senior majors. With the advance permission of the Department, two
appropriate mathematics courses numbered 240 or above may be substituted
for one Computer Science elective. Other variations in the required courses,
adapting the requirements to the special needs and interests of the individual
student, may be arranged in consultation with the Department.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Potential majors are strongly encouraged to pick up the latest copy of the
Informal Guide to Courses in Computer Science, which can be obtained from
the Departmental Office in Bronfman or on the world-wide web at
http://www.cs.williams.edu. This document contains much more information
on the major, including suggested patterns of course selection and advice
on courses relevant to different student goals.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
LABORATORY FACILITIES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Computer Science Department maintains two departmental computer laboratories
for students taking Computer Science courses. The Macintosh laboratory (used
in Computer Science 105, 108, 109, 134, 136, and 237) consists of an electronic
classroom containing 20 color Macintosh computers connected via an ethernet
network to Macintosh and Sun file and print servers. This laboratory also
contains a projection device enabling the instructor to display the computer
screen during lectures and demonstrations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Sun laboratory (used in courses numbered 237 and above) consists of a
network of powerful UNIX workstations, which are available exclusively to
students taking advanced Computer Science courses. These workstations also
support student and faculty research in computer science.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The degree with Honors in Computer Science is awarded to a student who has
demonstrated outstanding intellectual achievement in a program of study which
extends beyond the requirements of the regular major. The principal
considerations in recommending a student for the degree with honors will
be: mastery of core material, ability to pursue independent study of computer
science, originality in methods of investigation, and creativity in research.
Honors study is highly recommended for those students with strong academic
records in computer science who wish to attend graduate school, pursue high-level
industrial positions in computing, or who would simply like to experience
research in computer science.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Prospective Honors students are urged to consult with their departmental
adviser at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore or at
the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of study that could
lead to the degree with Honors. Such a program normally consists of Computer
Science 493 and 494 and a WSP of independent research under the guidance
of a Computer Science faculty member, culminating in a thesis which is judged
acceptable by the department. Under certain circumstances, the honors work
can consist of coordinated study involving a regular course and one semester
plus a WSP of independent study. The program culminates in a significant
piece of written work. The written work often includes a major computer program,
depending on the nature of the Honors work. All honors candidates are required
to give an oral presentation of their work in the Computer Science Colloquium.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students considering Honors work should obtain permission from the department
before registering in the fall of the senior year. Formal admission to candidacy
occurs at the beginning of the spring semester of the senior year and is
based on promising performance in the fall semester and winter study units
of Honors work. Recommendations for the degree with Honors will be made for
outstanding performance in the three Honors courses. Highest honors will
be recommended for students who have displayed exceptional ability, achievement,
or originality.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
INTRODUCTORY COURSES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The department offers four introductory courses - Computer Science 105:
Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques, Computer Science 108:
Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, Computer Science 109: The Art
and Science of Computer Graphics, and Computer Science 134: Introduction
to Computer Science. Complete descriptions of each of these courses are found
below. In this section we merely attempt to indicate for which students each
of these courses might be appropriate.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students planning to major in Computer Science will usually begin their studies
within the department by taking Computer Science 134. Computer Science 134
provides an introduction to computer science and programming. No experience
with computers or programming is required in order to take this course. Students
with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer
Science 136 (see Advanced Placement below). The combination of Computer Science
134 and Computer Science 136 serves as a prerequisite to most upper-level
courses in the department.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Those students interested in learning more about important new ideas and
developments in Computer Science, but who are not necessarily interested
in developing extensive programming skills, should consider Computer Science
105: Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques,Computer Science
108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, or Computer Science 109:
The Art and Science of Computer Graphics. Computer Science 108 discusses
the techniques used to construct computer systems that exhibit intelligent
behavior from understanding language to learning. Computer Science 109 introduces
students to the techniques of computer graphics used for special effects
in films, visualization in the sciences, and the creation of artistic images.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Non-majors primarily interested in developing programming skills for use
in other disciplines are directed to Computer Science 134. Alternately, those
expecting to construct programs that produce graphic images may wish to consider
the combination of Computer Science 109 followed by Computer Science 134.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Those students intending to take several Computer Science courses are urged
to begin satisfying their mathematics requirements early. Note in particular
that Mathematics 151 covers material complementing that in the introductory
courses (Computer Science 134 and 136) and is a prerequisite for many advanced
courses. As a result it should be taken in the first year a student is at
Williams or in the fall of the sophomore year if possible.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take
the Advanced Placement AB Examination in Computer Science. A score of 4 or
better on the AB exam is normally required for advanced placement in Computer
Science 136. Students scoring 3 or lower on that exam or who have taken the
Advanced Placement A Examination in Computer Science should consider enrolling
in Computer Science 134.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken
the Advanced Placement Examination should consult with the department. Such
students should have had a good course in computer science using a structured
language such as Pascal, C, or Java, and should have covered such topics
as recursion, arrays, records, files, and have some exposure to pointers.
Copies of programs written and titles of books used in courses will be helpful
in this process.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
PLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially
enrich their academic experience by completing a coherent plan of study in
one or more disciplines outside of their majors. With this in mind, we have
attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with options
in our department's curriculum ranging from two course sequences to collections
of courses equivalent to what would constitute a minor at institutions that
recognize such a concentration. Students interested in designing such a plan
of study in any department should discuss their plans in detail with a member
of the faculty. We welcome such inquiries from students. To assist students
making such plans, however, we include some suggestions below.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without
majoring in the department are encouraged to use the major requirements as
a guide. In particular, the four core courses required of majors are intended
to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of computer science.
Students seeking a concentration in computer science are urged to complete
at least two of these courses followed by one of our upper-level electives.
Such a program would typically require the completion of a total of five
computer science courses and one course in mathematics (MATH 151).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested
in developing skills in programming for use in other areas. For general
programming, Computer Science 134 followed by Computer Science 136 and 237
will provide students with a strong background in algorithm and data structure
design together with an understanding of issues of correctness and efficiency.
The sequence of courses Computer Science 109 and 134 would provide sufficient
competence in computer graphics for many students interested in applying
such knowledge either in the arts or sciences. For students requiring more
expertise in the techniques of computer graphics, Computer Science 136 and
371 could be added to form a four course sequence.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are, of course, many other alternatives. We encourage interested students
to consult with the department chair or other members of the department's
faculty.

GENERAL REMARKS
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Divisional Requirements
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All Computer Science courses listed may be used to satisfy the Division III
distribution requirement.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Alternate year courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Computer Science 108, 109, 336, 338T, 371, 373, 432, and 434 are each normally
offered every other year. All other Computer Science courses are normally
offered every year.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Course Numbering
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances
an increasing level of maturity in the subject that is expected of students.
Within a series, numeric order does not indicate the relative level of difficulty
of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number (particularly in
upper-level courses) generally indicates the area of computer science covered
by the course.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Course Descriptions
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Brief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below.
More detailed information on the offerings in the Department is available
in the Informal Guide to Courses in Computer Science that can be obtained
at the Departmental Office.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Courses open on a pass-fail basis
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students taking a Computer Science course on a pass-fail basis must meet
all the requirements set for students taking the course on a graded basis.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department
may be taken on a pass-fail basis. Permission will not be given to Computer
Science majors to meet any of the requirements of the major or honors degree
on this basis. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken
in the department beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass-fail basis.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Economics 101 Introduction to Economics
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One Economics course numbered 201 to 240
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Economics 251 Price and Allocation Theory
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Economics 252 Macroeconomics
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One statistical methods course, Economics 253 or 255 (If at all possible,
this course should be taken before 401.)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Three Economics electives, of which at least two must be selected from advanced
electives numbered 350 to 394. At least one elective must be selected from
a list of courses designated by the department which treat "Alternative
Paradigms."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Economics 401 Senior Seminar
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The primary objectives of the major are to develop an understanding of economic
aspects of contemporary life and to equip the student to analyze economic
issues of social policy. The introductory course stresses use of the basic
elements of economic analysis for understanding and resolving such issues.
In the following semester the student normally chooses one of the 200-level
courses, in which economic analysis is applied within a particular field.
The two required theory courses then provide a more thorough grounding in
economics as a discipline-by examining the strengths and weaknesses of the
price system in allocating economic resources, and by examining the aggregate
processes which determine employment, inflation, and growth. A course in
statistical methods (253 or 255) equips the major to understand and apply
the basic tools of quantitative empirical analysis. Majors must take three
electives, in two of which they apply parts of the theory learned in the
required theory courses. At least one elective must be a course that requires
students to consider alternative theoretical approaches to economics. In
the senior seminar, the student studies a series of current theoretical or
policy problems, applying analysis and research methods. The normal requirement
that nine economics courses be taken at Williams will usually be waived only
on the basis of transferred college credit deemed acceptable by the department.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Prospective majors please note that instructors in all sections of Economics
251, 252, and 253 feel free to use elementary calculus in assigned readings,
lectures, problem sets, and examinations. By elementary calculus is meant
differentiation of single variable polynomial functions and conditions for
a maximum or minimum; it does not include integration or multivariable calculus.
Instructors in advanced electives (courses numbered 350-394) may also use
elementary calculus in assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and
examinations. Students interested in graduate study in economics should consider
studying more advanced mathematics; see your adviser for specific suggestions.
Students are also reminded that some courses now have specific mathematics
requirements; see course descriptions.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ECONOMICS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We encourage all majors who have at least a 3.5 GPA in economics courses
to consider honors. To be admitted to candidacy for honors in economics a
student must complete a substantial piece of independent research. Two routes
to honors are open: the specialization route and the thesis route.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
a. Specialization route, consisting of these three units:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
1. Development of a thesis proposal in the second module of Economics 401.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
2. An Honors Winter Study Project (W030) in January of the senior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
3. Economics 404 Honors Seminar.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who have notified the department of their interest in writing an
honors thesis will use the second module of Economics 401 to develop a thesis
proposal. Such proposals frequently build on research papers completed for
advanced electives, but this is not a requirement. If the proposal is accepted,
the student will be admitted to W030. The department provides a memorandum
to majors with more details every spring and fall.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
b. Thesis route (Economics 493-W031-494):
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A few students each year will be accepted for year-long thesis research on
a subject closely related to the scholarly interests of a faculty member.
A student who hopes to do such independent and advanced research in close
association with a faculty member should begin to work out a mutually
satisfactory topic early in the second semester of his or her junior year.
Application to the department must be made before the end of the junior year
by submitting a detailed proposal for work under the supervision of the faculty
member. The WSP of the senior year is also spent on the thesis.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The College Bulletin states that students who wish to receive Honors must
take at least one course in addition to the minimum number required for the
major. Students who pursue a year-long thesis and therefore take both Economics
493 and 494 may substitute Economics 493 for an upper-level elective if they
wish to. Students who pursue the Specialization Route to Honors may not
substitute Economics 404 for an upper- (or lower-) level elective requirement.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
AFRO-AMERICAN STUDIES AND AREA STUDIES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A major in economics who concentrates in Afro-American or Area Studies may
substitute the non-economics courses in the concentration for one lower-level
elective in the economics major, but not for an advanced elective (350-394).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Note on Course Numbers: Courses between 201 and 240 are lower-level electives
and are open to first-year students who have taken 101. Courses between 260
and 349 are intermediate electives which do not build on specific prior
experience, but do require some maturity, so they have any two economics
courses or permission of the instructor as prerequisites. Courses 350 and
above are advanced electives primarily designed for economics and political
economy majors and have theory prerequisites.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
GRADUATE COURSES IN DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Juniors and seniors majoring in Economics or Political Economy may, with
the permission of the instructor, enroll in graduate courses given by the
Center for Development Economics (described below). A Center course may
substitute for an advanced elective in the major with permission of the chair
of the department.

COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The course offerings in English enable students, whether majors or non-majors,
to explore English and American literature in a variety of ways and to satisfy
their interests in particular authors and literary periods, in the major
types of literature-poetry, drama, and fiction-and in creative writing. The
department offers regularly two courses at the 100 level: 101 ("Techniques
of Reading") and 103 ("Expository Writing"). Both are designed primarily
for first-year students, although they are open to interested sophomores,
juniors, and seniors. English 101 is a prerequisite for admission to most
upper-level English courses, except for students who have satisfied the 101
requirement by achieving a score of 5 on the Advanced Placement examination
in English Literature. Prerequisites are noted in each course description.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most 200-level English courses are designed primarily for qualified first-year
students, sophomores, and junior and senior non-majors, but they are open
to junior and senior majors and count as major courses. 300-level English
courses are intended mainly for juniors and seniors, but they are open to
qualified sophomores and, in some few cases, to particularly qualified first-year
students. 300-level courses are generally open to non-majors, although in
the case of 300-level Major Seminars space for non-majors is limited, with
preference to junior and senior non-majors for whom the seminar fulfills
a requirement of a College program or department (see information below under
"Major Seminars"). The only courses offered by the English Department at
the 400 level are 497 and 498, independent study for senior majors pursuing
departmental honors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ADVISING
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The English Department does not assign majors to specific departmental advisors,
since we feel that doing so would prove unnecessarily constraining. Instead,
we encourage students, both majors and non-majors, to seek advice from
departmental faculty with whom they are studying or have studied. Majors
or non-majors who would like to have a regular departmental advisor-particularly
students who are thinking of going on to do graduate work in English or related
fields, or who wish to plan a particular program of study from among the
diverse offerings of the department-are encouraged to ask a faculty member
they know to serve in that capacity. Such arrangements can also be set up
with the help of the department chair.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Non-majors who wish to discuss English Department offerings are invited to
see any faculty member or the department chair.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The English major is designed to encourage familiarity with a broad range
of literature from the Middle Ages to the present day, to afford acquaintance
with representative contexts in which one can appreciate literary works,
and to foster an understanding of the nature of literary study. Each student
can fashion his or her own sequence of study within a basic pattern that
insures coherence and variety. This pattern comprises at least nine courses.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Majors are urged to select a balance of intermediate and advanced courses
and, in addition to courses on British literature, to elect one or more courses
dealing with literature by American writers, both white and nonwhite. They
are also urged to elect collateral courses in subjects such as art, music,
history, literary studies, philosophy, religion, theatre, and foreign languages
with a view to supporting and broadening their studies in literature. In
particular, the study of classical and modern languages, as well as of foreign
literatures in translation, is strongly recommended.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Requirements
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The nine courses required for the major must include the following:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(1) English 101, "Techniques of Reading." Students exempted by the department
from 101 will substitute an elective course.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(2) At least three courses dealing primarily with literature written before
1800 (identified in parentheses at end of course description). May be taken
as a major seminar.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(3) At least one course dealing primarily with literature written between
1800 and 1900 (identified in parentheses at end of course description). May
be taken as a major seminar.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(4) At least one "criticism" course (identified in parentheses at end of
course description). May be taken as a major seminar. Please note that when
a criticism course also deals with literature written before 1800, or between
1800 and 1900, the course may be used to satisfy either the criticism requirement
or the chronological requirement, but not both.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(5) At least one major seminar. The seminars provide students who have pursued
diverse areas of study the common experience of focusing on a basic literary
problem. Many seminars also satisfy the pre-1800, the 1800-1900, or the criticism
requirement. Normally to be taken during junior year.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The English Department offers three different routes toward honors: a creative
writing thesis, a critical thesis, and a critical specialization. The
requirements of each are described below. Candidates for the program should
normally have at least a 3.5 average in courses taken in English, but admission
will not depend solely on course grades. Formal application to pursue honors
must be made to the Director of Honors by April in the junior year. For the
Class of 1999, the Director of Honors is Professor Ilona Bell.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All routes require honors students to take a minimum of TEN regular-semester
courses (rather than the nine otherwise required for the major), and to devote
their senior year Winter Study course to their honors projects. More
specifically:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students doing a creative writing thesis must, by graduation, take at least
nine regular-semester courses, and, in addition, take English 497 (Honors
Independent Study, fall) and English 031 (Honors Thesis, Winter Study) during
senior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students writing a critical thesis must, by graduation, take at least eight
regular-semester courses, and, in addition, take English 497 and English
498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and spring) and English 031 (Honors Thesis,
Winter Study) during senior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students pursuing a critical specialization must, by graduation, take at
least eight regular-semester courses, and in addition, take English 497 and
English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and spring) and English 030 (Honors
Specialization, Winter Study) during senior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A student who is highly qualified to pursue honors, but who, for compelling
reasons, is unable to pursue a year-long project, may petition the department
for permission to pursue a critical thesis or critical specialization over
one semester and the Winter Study term. Since the norm for these projects
is a full year, such permission will be granted only in exceptional
circumstances. If granted, the standards for admission and for evaluating
the final project would be identical to those that apply to year-long honors
projects.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All students who wish to apply to the Honors Program are required to consult
with a prospective faculty advisor, as well as with the Director of Honors,
before April of the junior year. In early April, candidates submit a one-page
preliminary proposal that provides as specific a description as possible
of the proposed project. The Director of Honors reviews proposals with the
faculty advisor, and then makes a recommendation to the whole department.
Students whose proposals are accepted receive provisional admission to the
program at this time. Students not admitted to the honors program are advised,
when appropriate, about other possible ways of pursuing their interests (e.g.,
independent studies, regular departmental courses).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Admitted students must consult with their advisors before the end of the
spring semester in junior year to discuss reading or work pertinent to writing
the formal honors prospectus. This prospectus, due one week before the first
day of classes in the fall semester of senior year, is a decisive factor
in final admission to the program. Two copies of the formal prospectus must
be submitted-one to the Director of Honors, and the other to the student's
advisor. After reviewing the prospectuses and consulting with advisors, the
department's Honors Committee determines final admission to the program.
Applicants are notified during the first week of the fall term.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While grades for the fall and Winter Study terms are deferred until both
the honors project and review process are completed, students must do the
equivalent of at least B+ work to continue in the program. Should the student's
work in the fall semester not meet this minimal standard, the course will
convert to a standard independent study (English 397), and the student will
register for a regular Winter Study project. A student engaged in a year-long
project must likewise perform satisfactorily in Winter Study (English 030
or 031) to enroll in English 498 in the spring semester. When such is not
the case, the Winter Study course will be converted to an independent study
or "99."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students are required to submit to their advisor, on the due dates specified
below, three final copies of their written work. While letter grades for
honors courses are assigned by the faculty advisor, the recommendation about
honors is made by two other faculty members, who serve as readers of the
student's work. These readers, after consulting with the faculty advisor,
report their recommendation to the whole department, which awards either
Highest Honors, Honors, or no honors. Honors of any kind are contingent upon
satisfactory completion of courses in the major during the spring semester
of the senior year. Highest Honors are normally awarded only to students
whose performance in both the honors program and regular courses in the major
has been exceptional. All students who are awarded honors participate in
a series of informal presentations at the end of the spring term in senior
year.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Creative Writing Thesis
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The creative writing thesis involves the completion of a significant body
of fiction or poetry during the fall semester and Winter Study of the senior
year. (With permission of the Honors Committee, the thesis may be undertaken
during the Winter Study period and the spring semester of the senior year.)
Since a student will most likely include in the thesis writing done in earlier
semesters, a creative writing thesis usually involves only the fall semester
and the Winter Study period, rather than the full year allotted to complete
the critical essay.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Requirements for admission include outstanding work in an introductory and
an advanced workshop, a recommendation from one of the creative writing teachers
(who will then act as thesis advisor), a brief preliminary proposal, and
the approval of the departmental Honors Committee. The formal prospectus
consists of a one-page description of the project, including its relation
to work completed and in-progress. Students must also submit a writing sample.
A creative writing thesis begun in the fall is due on the last day of Winter
Study. The methods of evaluation are identical to those for critical projects
(but their page limits do not apply).
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Critical Thesis
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The critical thesis involves writing a substantial scholarly and/or critical
essay during both semesters as well as the Winter Study period of the senior
year. The formal prospectus, a two- to three-page description of the thesis
project, should present a coherent proposal indicating the range of the thesis,
the questions to be investigated, the methods to be used, and the arguments
likely to be considered, along with a brief bibliography.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Significant progress on the thesis, including a substantial amount of writing
(to be determined by student and advisor), is required by the end of the
fall semester. A first draft of the thesis must be completed by the end of
the Winter Study Period. The spring semester is to be devoted to revising
and refining the work and to shaping its several chapters into a unified
argument. Ideally the length of the honors essay will be between 40 and 50
pages (a page being approximately 250 words). The thesis may not be longer
than 75 pages. The finished thesis is due on the second Friday following
spring break.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Critical Specialization
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The critical specialization route is intended to provide students with an
opportunity for making a series of forays into an area of interest that is
both broad in scope and related to work undertaken in at least two courses.
At least one of these courses must be in the English Department, and both
need to have been taken by the end of fall term in senior year. The critical
specialization must be united by a common area of interest, such as a given
literary form or historical period, a topic that cuts across several periods,
an issue in literary theory, a topic that connects literary and cultural
issues, a comparative literature or interdisciplinary topic. Students are
encouraged to propose specialization topics of their own devising. The following
examples are meant only to suggest the kinds of topics appropriate to a critical
specialization: lyric traditions, postmodern narrative, magic realism, Dante
and modern literature, Freud and literature, the poet as citizen, new historicist
approaches to literature, feminist film criticism.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to reading primary works, the student is expected to read secondary
sources, which describe or define issues critical to the area of specialization.
The formal prospectus, a two- to three-page description of the project, should
specify the area and range of the study, the issues likely to explored, and
the methods to be used for their investigation. This prospectus should also
describe the relation between previous course work and the proposed
specialization, and include a brief bibliography of secondary works. The
pursuit of the specialization route requires the following: (1) Writing a
set of three essays, each about ten pages long (a page being approximately
250 words), which together advance a flexibly related set of arguments. The
first two essays are due by the end of the fall semester, and the third by
the end of Winter Study. (2) Developing an extended annotated bibliography
(about four- to five-pages long) of selected secondary sources, explaining
their importance to the area of specialization (due mid-February). (3) Meeting
with the three faculty evaluators (one of whom is the advisor) during the
last two weeks in February to discuss the trio of essays and the annotated
bibliography. (4) Writing a fourth essay of ten- to twelve-pages, the purpose
of which is to consider matters that arose during the faculty-student discussion
and to reflect on the evolution and outcome of the intellectual journey
undertaken by the student. This final essay is due on the second Friday after
spring break.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The same three faculty members are involved throughout the assessment process,
and the standards and methods of evaluation are the same as for other kinds
of honors projects, with the following exception: For the specialization
route, the evaluation will also include the student's performance in the
discussion with the three faculty readers, and that discussion will include
not only the student's writing but also secondary sources.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
MAJOR SEMINARS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All English majors must take at least one Major Seminar, normally during
junior year; when space permits, majors are encouraged to take more than
one seminar. English majors have priority in registering for Major Seminars.
Enrollment in Major Seminars is limited to 15.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When space permits, non-majors are welcome to request admission to a Major
Seminar; they should consult with the English Department chair at April
pre-registration. Spaces are limited, and preference will be given to non-majors
for whom a seminar would fulfill a requirement of a College program or department
(e.g., African-American Studies, American Studies, Literary Studies, Theatre,
and Women's and Gender Studies).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
IMPORTANT NOTE: Since the size of each seminar is limited, majors, when
registering, must indicate three choices in order of preference. Majors who
do not register with the English Department during the regular spring
registration period must communicate their preferences to the department
chair; those who communicate their preferences significantly later than the
April pre-registration period are likely to find their range of choices limited.
Non-majors who wish to enroll in a seminar must contact the department chair;
while they need only indicate one choice, they should explain their
qualifications to enter the seminar and how the seminar fits into their academic
programs. Please note, in all cases, that registering for the Major Seminar
only with the Registrar-without communicating with the chair of the English
Department-will not of itself secure majors or non-majors places in the seminars
they have chosen.
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
CREATIVE WRITING COURSES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students interested in taking a creative writing course should preregister
and be sure to attend the first class meeting. Class size is limited; final
selections will be made by the instructor shortly after the first class meeting.
Preregistration does not guarantee a place in the class. Students with questions
should consult the appropriate instructor.

CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The concentration in Environmental Studies allows students to focus some
of their elective courses in an integrated, interdisciplinary study of the
environment-that is, the natural world, both in itself and as it has been
modified by human activity. The purpose of the program is to provide the
tools and ideas needed to engage constructively with the environmental and
social issues brought about by changes in population, economic activity,
and values. Environmental controversies typically call upon citizens and
organizations to grasp complex, uncertain science, contending human values,
and ethical choices-in short, to deal with matters for which the liberal
arts are a necessary but not sufficient preparation. Environmental Studies
accordingly includes courses in natural sciences, social sciences, humanities,
and the arts, in order to equip students with the broad educational background
needed to analyze complex environmental matters and to fashion pragmatic,
feasible solutions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The concentration is administered by the Center for Environmental Studies
(CES), located in Kellogg House. Founded in 1968, CES is one of the oldest
environmental studies programs at a liberal arts college. In addition to
the academic program, CES is the focus of a varied set of activities in which
students lead and participate, often with other members of the Williams
community. The Matt Cole Memorial Library at Kellogg House holds a substantial
collection of books, periodicals, unpublished documents, maps, and electronic
media. Kellogg House also houses a new geographic information system laboratory
as well as study and meeting facilities available to students and student
groups. The Center administers the Hopkins Memorial Forest, a 2430-acre natural
area northwest of campus, where field-study sites, a laboratory, and
passive-recreation opportunities may be found in all seasons. CES also operates
an environmental analysis laboratory at the Bronfman Science Center.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The environmental studies program has three overlapping components:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* In order to earn the concentration in environmental studies, students must
complete a set of seven courses, described further below.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* All students are strongly encouraged to meet the Three Places goal described
below.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Students are encouraged to pursue Honors in Environmental Studies by planning
a senior thesis as described below, normally working together with the honors
program in their disciplinary departments.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Concentration Requirements
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Core courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
101 Humans in the Landscape
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
203 Ecology
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
302 Environmental Planning and Analysis Workshop
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
402 Senior Seminar
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Note that enrollments in Environmental Studies 102, a field course, are limited.
Students must consult with one of the instructors in that course during autumn
semester, in order to assure enrollment. Environmental Studies 102 must be
taken before the junior year, and Environmental Studies 101 is strongly
recommended to be taken before the end of junior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
1The Center's faculty has considered several times in the past whether a
major in Environmental Studies is appropriate for Williams. Although a few
students have completed interdisciplinary contract majors in environmental
studies, the faculty continue to believe that, for most students, the combination
of in-depth understanding in a discipline, together with the synthetic skills
fostered in the program, provides the best preparation for graduate training,
a career, and active citizen participation. The leadership and contributions
of our graduates, now numbering over 800, affirm the soundness of this approach.

In addition to courses fulfilling the concentration requirements, the following
electives and related electives are offered:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Environmental Studies 397, 398 Independent Study
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Environmental Studies 493-W031-494 Senior Research and Thesis
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
ArtS 329 Architectural Design II
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Winter Study courses play an important role in the program, offering
opportunities to experiment in fields unfamiliar to the student, and for
interdisciplinary topics to be developed by faculty working alone and in
teams. Students are urged to review each year's Winter Study offerings bearing
in mind their interests in the environment.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Rationale for Course Numbering
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The numbering sequence of the four required courses reflects the order in
which they should be taken, although Environmental Studies 302 may be taken
in the senior or sophomore year if a student is away junior year. Cross-listed
courses are assigned the same number as the departmental number whenever
possible.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Three Places-A Goal
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The human place in natural landscapes is intrinsically geographic, and learning
about humans in particular places is an essential part of environmental studies.
By the time each student in Environmental Studies graduates, she or he should
have developed intellectual insight into and personal experience of three
places: Home; Here-the Berkshires; and There-an alien place. For practical
purposes, There is a place where the geography is unusual in the student's
experience (e.g., developing country, inner city, arctic), so are the
socioeconomic circumstances (for example, per capita income might be a small
fraction of a year's tuition at Williams), and the working language is not
standard English. Although this goal is not a requirement for the concentration,
it is a significant aspect of the program, and CES resources are aimed in
part at enabling all students to meet this goal. For example, students are
encouraged to pursue summer internships in their Home communities, or to
do semester or Winter Study courses at locations outside the temperate zones
(There); field courses in natural science or history courses emphasizing
New England can deepen familiarity with Here. Students concentrating in
Environmental Studies should plan Winter Study courses and summer work or
study experiences with the Three Places goal in mind, particularly the
experiences There and at Home. Courses not in the list of electives for the
concentration may be considered as substitutes, on a case by case basis,
if they also meet the Three Places goal in a way not otherwise available
in the program. Students should see the program director for further information.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Honors in Environmental Studies
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A student earns honors in Environmental Studies by successfully completing
a rigorous, original independent research project under the supervision of
two or more members of the faculty, including at least one member of the
CES faculty. The research project should be reported and defended in a thesis
and orally. A student may undertake an honors thesis and submit it to both
his or her major department and Environmental Studies; petitions for a joint
honors project should be approved by the department chair and the director
of the program no later than the beginning of the student's senior year.
Students who pursue honors in Environmental Studies alone should enroll in
Environmental Studies 493-W031-494, Senior Research and Thesis, in addition
to completing the requirements for the concentration.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because most research requires sustained field, laboratory, or library work
that is difficult to combine with conventional coursework, students are strongly
encouraged to spend the summer before senior year doing honors research.
Funds to support student research are available from restricted endowments
of the Center, and an open competition is held each spring, to allocate the
limited resources. Some departments also provide limited support for summer
thesis research. Students and their faculty sponsors should plan the thesis
with the possibility of summer research in mind.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A faculty recommendation for honors in Environmental Studies will be made
on the basis of the academic rigor, interdisciplinary synthesis, independence.
and originality demonstrated by the student and in the completed thesis.
In contemplating an honors thesis. students should take into account their
mastery of the basic materials and skills (often in more than one academic
discipline), their ability to work independently, and their commitment and
desire to pursue a sometimes arduous but typically rewarding process that
combines intellectual achievement with tests of character and fortitude.

  INTERDEPARTMENTAL PROGRAM FOR EXPERIMENTAL AND CROSS-DISCIPLINARY STUDIES
</H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Chair, Associate Professor STEVEN B. GERRARD
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Advisory Committee: Professors: DARROW, SWANN, TAYLOR, WHITE. Associate
Professors: GERRARD, CHRISTENSEN.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This Program is designed to facilitate and promote innovations in curricular
offerings in relation both to interdisciplinary conceptual focus and experimental
pedagogical form. It provides support for faculty and student efforts to
develop a curriculum that creatively responds to intellectual needs and modes
of teaching/learning that currently fall outside the conventional pattern.
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
FIRST-YEAR RESIDENTIAL SEMINARS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The First-Year Residential Seminars are part of a program designed to help
students explore new ways of integrating their social and intellectual lives.
Students who elect these seminars live together in the same residential unit.
They take one seminar together during the fall semester, and enrollment in
the seminar is restricted to students in the program. The seminar explores
topics and issues that can be expected to promote lively discussions both
in and out of class. It may be team-taught and may contain interdisciplinary
subject matter.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All entering first-year students have the opportunity to express interest
in participating in this program; if more students are interested than there
are spaces available (approximately 23), selection is done randomly. Participants
must commit themselves to taking FRS 101.

  FRENCH
</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR-French Language and Literature
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The French major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level with at
least one course each from the following areas:
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
(1) Poetry and Poetics
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
(2) Prose Narrative and Fiction
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
(3) Theatre and Dramatic Literature
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
(4) Thematics, Special Topics, Survey Courses
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Students must also take a 400-level capstone seminar which may count toward
any of the four required areas.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Working with the major advisor, the student will formulate a curricular plan
that will ensure balance and coherence in courses taken. Such balance and
coherence will be based on the above areas of literary and cultural
investigation. Prospective majors should discuss their program with the major
advisor by the end of their sophomore year. This is especially imperative
for students who are planning to spend a part or all of their junior year
in France.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The major seeks to provide training in literary and cultural analysis and
linguistic expression through the study of selected texts. Emphasis is placed
on the changes in form and subject matter from the Renaissance to the modern
era.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Inasmuch as all courses in French assume the active participation of each
student in discussions conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance
at class meetings is expected.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR-French Studies
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The major in French Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides
students with the opportunity to acquire skills and knowledge embracing the
cultural, historical, social, and political heritage of France. The program
allows for an individualized course of study involving work in several
departments and the opportunity to study abroad.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students electing the French Studies major should register with the French
Studies faculty advisor during their sophomore year. At that time they should
submit a feasibility plan that articulates their projected program.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The French Studies major consists of ten courses satisfying the following
requirements:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
1. At least two courses in French language and/or literature above the French
103 level.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
2. A senior seminar.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
3. Electives: The remaining courses needed to complete the major must be
drawn from at least three different departments and relate primarily to an
aspect of the culture, history, society, and politics of France. These courses
will be selected in consultation with members of the Department of Romance
Languages. Appropriate electives might include:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
ArtH 254 Impressionism<BR>
History 307 The French and Haitian Revolutions <BR>
Religion 301 Psychology of Religion <BR>
All courses in French Literature and Language above the 103 level.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition, students should take at least two non-language courses in which
the course materials are primarily in the language of the region. For students
who do not undertake study abroad, these will usually be literature courses.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN FRENCH
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree
with honors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates
are required to devote to their theses two semesters of independent study
(beyond the nine courses required for the major) and the Winter Study Period
of their senior year (493-W031-494). The thesis will be written in French
and will usually be in the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates
are expected to submit thesis proposals in May of their junior year. By the
end of the first semester of the senior year, students will normally have
finished the research for the thesis. By the end of the Winter Study Period,
candidates will submit to the Department an outline and rough draft of their
work. At this time, the student will make a presentation of his project at
a departmental colloquium. The thesis will be discussed and evaluated to
determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors program.
The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising and
rewriting the thesis. The completed dissertation in its final form will be
due at the end of April. The second route is a group of three clearly related
courses (offered by the Department of Romance Languages or by other Departments,
such as History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which may be
counted in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will
be an Independent Study (plus senior year WSP 030). At the end of the Spring
semester the student will write an essay that synthesizes the content of
the three related courses. Students may apply for this route by November
2 of the senior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the Department's
recommendation for graduation with honors will be based on the originality
and thoroughness of the finished project.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE CERTIFICATE IN FRENCH
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Certificate in French Language and Culture consists of a sequence of
seven courses for which the student must earn the cumulative grade average
of B or higher. In addition, the student must achieve a score of 60 on the
College Level Examination Program (CLEP) College French (Levels 1 and 2)
test. This test will be administered by the Department of Romance Languages
once a year during the month of April to all candidates for the Certificate
in French Language and Culture.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For students with little or no prior background in French, the course sequence
consists of RLFR 101-102, RLFR 103-104, and any three courses in French above
the 104-level, one of which must be at the 200-level or higher. If the student
begins with RLFR 103-104, the sequence then continues with three courses
in French above the 104-level, including one at the 200-level or higher.
The student must then take two more courses either in French above the 104-level
or in other departments. The courses in other departments must contain a
significant component of material representing French or Francophone cultural,
intellectual, political, social, and art-historical topics. The choice of
the courses must be approved by the Department.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
PLACEMENT
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A placement test in French is administered at Williams at the opening of
the fall semester. Incoming first-year students who register for any French
course above the 101-102 level must take this test, regardless of their previous
preparation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
STUDY ABROAD
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
French majors are strongly encouraged to complete part of the major requirements
by studying abroad either during the academic year or the summer. Through
its special affiliation with the Hamilton Junior Year in France, the Department
offers a comprehensive academic and cultural experience in a francophone
environment. Major credit for study abroad will normally be assigned as follows:
up to 1 credit for one semester; up to 3 credits for a full year or two
semesters. The final assignment of credit will be authorized in consultation
with the student's major advisor upon return to Williams. Such credits can
only be determined by review of course format, materials, and evidence of
satisfactory academic performance.

MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Geosciences major is designed (1) to provide an understanding of the
physical and biological evolution of our planet and its interacting global
systems, (2) to help us learn to live in harmony with our environment, and
(3) to appreciate our place within the vastness of earth history. Forces
within the earth are responsible for the development of mountain ranges and
ocean basins. Wind, waves, rivers, and glaciers have shaped the surface of
the earth, providing the landscapes we see today. Fossils encased in sedimentary
rocks supply evidence for the evolution of life and help to record the history
of the earth.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who graduate with a major in Geosciences from Williams can enter
into several different fields of geoscience or can use their background in
other careers. Those students who have continued in the geosciences are involved
today, especially after graduate training, in environmental fields ranging
from hydrology to earthquake prediction, in the petroleum and mining industries,
federal and state geological surveys, geological consulting firms, and teaching
and research in universities, colleges, and secondary schools. Graduates
who have entered business or law have also found many applications for their
geoscience background. Other graduates now in fields as diverse as art and
medicine pursue their interest in the out-of-doors with a deeper appreciation
for the natural world around them.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Geosciences major sequence includes, after any 100-level course, five
designated advanced courses, two elective courses, and either Geosciences
212 (Invertebrate Paleobiology) or Geosciences 303 (Igneous and Metamorphic
Petrology).
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Sequence Courses (required of majors)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
201 Geomorphology
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
301 Structural Geology
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
302 Sedimentation
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
401 Stratigraphy
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Elective courses may be clustered to provide concentrations in selected fields.
Suggested groupings are listed below as guidelines for course selections,
but other groups are possible according to the interests of the students.
Departmental advisers are given for the different fields of Geosciences.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I Environmental Geoscience. For students interested in surface processes
and the application of geology to environmental problems such as land use
planning, resource planning, environmental impact analysis, and environmental
law. Such students should also consider enrolling in the coordinate program
of the Center for Environmental Studies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
II Oceanography, Stratigraphy and Sedimentation. For students interested
in the study of modern and ancient sedimentary environments and the marine
organisms that inhabited them.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
101 Biodiversity in Geologic Time
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
104 Oceanography
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
206 Geological Sources of Energy
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
212 Invertebrate Paleobiology
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(Students interested in Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation should
consult with Professors M. Johnson or Cox.)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
III The Solid Earth. For students interested in plate tectonics, the processes
active within the earth, the origin and deformation of rocks and minerals,
and mineral exploration.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
102 An Unfinished Planet
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
105 Geology Outdoors
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(Students interested in The Solid Earth should consult with Professors Wobus
or Karabinos.)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the consent of the department, certain courses at the 200 level or higher
in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, or Physics may be substituted for elective
courses in the major. Credit may be granted in the Geosciences major for
American Maritime Studies 211/Geosciences 210 (Oceanographic Processes) or
American Maritime Studies 311/Biology 231 (Marine Ecology) taken at Mystic
Seaport.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students considering graduate work in the Earth Sciences should also take
courses in the allied sciences and mathematics in addition to the requirements
of the Geosciences major. The selection of outside courses will depend on
the field in which a student intends to specialize. Most geoscience graduate
schools require Chemistry 101, 102, and Mathematics through 105. For those
going into Environmental Geoscience, courses in the Environmental Studies
Program are recommended. For those considering Oceanography, Stratigraphy,
and Sedimentation, Biology 102 and Biology 203 are suggested. For students
entering Solid-Earth fields, Physics 131 and 132 are recommended.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GEOSCIENCES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to be recommended for the degree with Honors, a student is expected
to have completed at least two semesters and a Winter Study project (031)
of independent research culminating in a thesis which demonstrates outstanding
achievement of an original and innovative nature. The principal considerations
in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of
fundamental material and skills, ability to pursue independent study
successfully, and demonstrated student interest and motivation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Further advice on the major can be obtained from the Department Chair.

LANGUAGE STUDY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire
all four linguistic skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing.
German 101-W-102 covers German grammar in full. German 103 combines a review
of grammar with extensive practice in reading and conversation. German 104
aims to develop facility in speaking, writing, and reading. German 109 combines
very advanced language study with the examination of topics in German-speaking
cultures. Students who have studied German in secondary school must take
the placement test in September to determine which course to take.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
STUDY ABROAD
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in
German to spend a semester or year studying in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland,
either independently or in one of several approved foreign study programs.
German 104 or the equivalent and junior standing are normally prerequisite
for study abroad.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION

The Department regularly offers courses on German literature in translation
for those students who have little or no knowledge of German, but who wish
to become acquainted with the major achievements in German literary and
intellectual history.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ADVANCED STUDIES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department offers a variety of advanced courses for students who wish
to investigate German literature and thought in the original. German 109
and 202 are given each year and are recommended as preparation for 300- and
400-level courses. 300-level courses are generally offered once every three
years, allowing the student to gain comprehensive knowledge of German literature.
The seminar 402 has a different topic every year and may be repeated. Students
with special interests are encouraged to consult department members about
the possibility of independent study (497,498). German 104 or equivalent
preparation is prerequisite to all advanced courses.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE CERTIFICATE IN GERMAN
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the Certificate
in German offers a useful tool for using the language in a wide variety of
disciplines. The sequence of language and culture courses is designed to
supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to expand
his or her knowledge in a related field.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The course of study for the certificate gives credit for German 101 and 102,
which do not count toward the major. Students who enter Williams with previous
training in German may substitute more advanced courses for the 100- and
200-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required
courses. Thus, in order to earn a certificate a student must take no fewer
than five courses (including three language courses) after enrolling at Williams.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence.
In addition, they must receive a score of at least 650 (out of a possible
800) on the ETS (Educational Testing Service) Comprehensive Proficiency Test.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
-at least one course on German intellectual, political, or social history
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJORS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department supports two distinct majors: German Studies and German
Literature.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Electives
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Seven other courses. At least four must focus on topics in German literary
history. Two may be either language courses above 103 or relevant courses
offered in other departments such as Literary Studies and Philosophy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
German Literature majors may receive major credit for up to four courses
taken during study abroad.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GERMAN
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the beginning of the second semester of the senior year, students may
nominate themselves to candidacy for the degree with honors. By the end of
the junior year at the latest, however, they must have established, in
consultation with the Department, their qualifications for undertaking the
project, the pattern of study to be followed, and the standards of performance.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students earn honors by completing a senior thesis (German 493-W031-494)
of honors quality.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
COURSE NUMBERS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The course numbering system used by the History Department reflects the type
and level of course. 100-level courses are First-Year Seminars on relatively
focused topics, enrollment limited to 20 participants, with preference given
first to first-year students and then to sophomores. They are intended to
help students develop skills needed in the study of history. 200-level courses
are introductory courses open to all students, and offered in either small
or large section formats, depending upon the individual course. These courses
are intended to introduce students to the history of a particular area, country,
or epoch, but may also be useful to students who would like more background
in an area they already have studied. Courses 300-349 are advanced topical
courses, generally enrollment limited to 25-30 students but sometimes taught
in a larger format. Because these courses may presume some familiarity with
the general field in which the 300-level is located, instructors may recommend
that students take an appropriate introductory course before registering
for the elective. Courses at the 350-399 level are seminars which will be
taught with enrollment limited to 15 students. Each seminar will investigate
a relatively focused topic in depth and will require that students engage
in some form of historical research and/or produce a substantial piece of
historical writing. Instructors may recommend that students take one or more
courses (designated in the Catalog) before registering for the seminar. However,
enrollment priority must be given to senior history majors and to history
majors generally.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE FIRST YEAR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The curriculum in History for the first year a student is at Williams is
designed to teach students the skills they will need to study history and
to introduce them to a wide variety of the historical experience. It consists,
therefore, of two types of courses: first-year seminars (100-level) and
introductory courses (200-level).
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ADVISING
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with Professor
Wood, the department chair, Mrs. Swift, the department secretary, or any
other member of the department about the history major.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. All majors must meet with
their advisor, or the department chair, during the first week of classes
during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semester registration
period in order to have their courses and plans for the history major approved.
Students who are interested in the senior honors program or graduate school
should contact Professor Tracy. Prospective study abroad students should
contact Mrs. Swift.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students will be granted one semester course credit toward the course requirement
in the History Major for each Advanced Placement examination on which they
have received a 4 or a 5. Such credit may not be used to satisfy the Group
Requirements.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All first-year students with Advanced Placement Credit are encouraged to
enroll in history courses at the 200 or 300 level, or, with the permission
of the instructor, a 350+ seminar, thus taking advantage of their opportunity
to do more advanced work in their first year at Williams.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The major consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Required Courses in the Major
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One course from the History 301 series*
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At least one 350+-level seminar
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
*Required of all History majors, History 301 will be a series of courses,
grouped under the title "Reflections on History." Each course will consider
the different approaches historians have taken and take to the past. Majors
will normally take a 301 in their junior year or, if abroad their junior
year, in their senior year. Students who declare as History majors in the
spring of their sophomore year will be asked to pick two different 301 courses
from among those to be offered in their junior year. The department will
then assign majors to one of the two 301 courses for which they have indicated
their preference.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Elective Courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Seven (or more) additional semester courses in History, at least one of these
to be chosen from each of the following three groups:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Group A: American History, Canadian History
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Group B: European History (including Russian History)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Group C: African, Asian, Latin American History
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition, at least one of the courses used to satisfy the group requirement
must be a pre-modern course, which will be labeled Group D in the catalog.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A single course can meet the requirement for no more than one of Groups A
through C. First-Year Seminars (100-level courses) and History 301 cannot
be used to meet the Group Requirement. Only one 100-level course can count
toward the major.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Concentration in the Major
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All students are required to develop a concentration within the History major.
A concentration will consist of three courses linked by common themes, geography,
or time period. It is strongly recommended that one of these courses be a
350+-level History seminar. Courses in the concentration may be used to fulfill
the group requirements. The concentration should be tentatively designed
in consultation with a faculty adviser at spring registration during the
sophomore year. Students are encouraged to consult with a faculty member
who works in their proposed area of concentration. The final version of the
concentration should be submitted to the faculty adviser for approval at
the time of registration in spring semester of the junior year.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN HISTORY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The History Department offers a thesis route to the degree with honors. This
involves a ten course major as well as an independent WSP. Application to
enter the thesis program should be made by spring registration in the junior
year and should be based on a solid record of work of honors caliber, normally
defined as maintaining at least a B+ average in courses taken for the major.
Students who will be away during spring semester of their junior year should
make arrangements to apply before leaving to study away. In addition to doing
the research for and writing a thesis of approximately 75-100 pages, students
will participate in the Department's honors seminar (History 493) and will
participate in special presentations under the History Department's Class
of 1960 Scholars Program.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Senior Thesis and Honors Colloquium
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students wishing to undertake independent research or considering graduate
study are encouraged to participate in the thesis program and honors seminar.
In addition to researching and writing a thesis of 75-100 pages, students
will take History 493 Senior Thesis Research/Writing Seminar in the fall
semester of their senior year and will enroll in W031 during Winter Study
and History 494 in the spring.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who intend to write an honors thesis must submit a proposal to the
History Department at the time of spring registration in their junior year.
Normally it is the responsibility of the individual student to procure the
agreement of a member of the department to act as her or his thesis adviser,
and the student therefore must consult with a member of the department about
a thesis topic and a possible thesis adviser prior to submitting a proposal
to the department. A student who is uncertain of which member of the department
might be an appropriate adviser, or who otherwise is unable to find an adviser,
should contact the chair of the honors committee. An honors thesis proposal
must be signed by a member of the History Department. Normally the thesis
topic should be related to course work which the student has previously done.
Students should be aware, however, that while the department will try to
accommodate all students who qualify to pursue honors, particular topics
may be deemed unfeasible and students may have to revise their topics
accordingly. Final admission to the honors thesis program will depend on
the department's assessment of the qualifications of the student and the
feasibility of the project. No student should enroll in HIST 493-W031-HIST
494 until notified of admission to the honors thesis program.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Successful applicants will enroll in History 493-W031-494. During the fall,
students should work regularly on their research and consult frequently with
their advisers. Throughout the semester, honors candidates will also present
progress reports to the Seminar (HIST 493), discuss problems, and share
solutions. At the end of the term, each student will submit copies of written
work to the seminar for group discussion. Performance in the seminar will
be evaluated on the basis of class participation and completed written work
and will determine if a student will continue in the thesis program. For
students proceeding to W031 and HIST 494, performance in the fall semester
will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the end of the year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who are deemed to be making satisfactory progress on their research
and writing at this point will be allowed to continue with the thesis. They
will devote the entire WSP period to thesis work. They should conclude their
research during Winter Study and complete at least one chapter of their thesis
for submission to their adviser before the end of WSP. At the end of WSP,
the honors committee will formally consult with advisers and make recommendations
to the department concerning which students should be allowed to proceed
with the thesis. During the first week of the second semester, students will
present a draft chapter of their thesis to the final meeting of the honors
seminar. Completed theses will be due in mid-April, following which each
student will prepare and present a short oral presentation of his or her
thesis. Another student who has read the thesis will then give a critique
of the thesis, which will be followed by a general discussion by students
and members of the department.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
LANGUAGE
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Study of a foreign language is basic to the understanding of other cultures.
Particularly those students who might wish to do graduate work in History
are encouraged to enroll in language courses at Williams.

A major in the History of Science is not offered, but the occasional contract
major in it or a related interdisciplinary field is possible. Courses in
the History of Science are designed primarily to complement and strengthen
work in other major fields. Although any of the courses may be taken separately,
studying related courses in other departments will enhance their value, because
by nature, History of Science is interdisciplinary.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The following will serve as examples: the 101 course is an introduction to
science and technology studies, and concentrates on key aspects of contemporary
science and technology relevant to many issues of living in a technological
society. "Scientific Revolutions" (HSCI 224) deals with the emergence of
modern science in the 1600s and 1700s, and with subsequent revolutions in
scientific thought; as such it complements courses related to modern European
History. "Technology and Culture" (HSCI 305), an introduction to the history
of technology, offers materials which support work in a wide variety of fields:
environmental studies, political science, history, philosophy, and the sciences.
The 216 course treats past and present science and technology in the light
of women's studies and the sociology of knowledge. History of Science 240
traces the influential role of science and invention in the shaping of American
culture, and complements offerings in American Studies and American History.
HSCI 320, an historical overview of the ideas, practice, and organization
of medicine, provides context for related coursework in History, Philosophy,
and the Premed Program.

Williams offers a variety of courses specifically directed to students interested
in Jewish Studies. In addition, many other courses incorporate topics relevant
to the study of Judaism. Students are encouraged to integrate courses from
diverse disciplines with a focus in Jewish history, religion, literature,
language, and thought. Thus, rather than emphasizing a particular method
of inquiry, Jewish Studies courses bring together students from different
departments who share interest in a common topic. As a result, Jewish subjects
become analyzed from a multitude of perspectives (religious, philosophical,
political, historical, psychological, literary, etc.). Williams offers two
types of courses related to Jewish Studies: Courses directly focusing on
Jewish topics and courses partially devoted to some aspect of Judaism.

The Bronfman Fund for Judaic Studies was established in 1980 by Edgar M.
Bronfman '50, Samuel Bronfman II '75, and Matthew Bronfman '80. The Bronfman
Fund provides opportunities for the Williams community to learn about Jewish
history and culture, both within the College's formal curriculum and through
the planning of major events on Jewish themes.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Morris Wiener and Stephen R. Wiener '56 Fund for Jewish Studies was
established in 1997 through the estate of Stephen R. Wiener '56. The Wiener
gifts have provided an endowment to support a faculty position in Modern
Jewish Thought, and are used to underwrite an annual lecture, forum or event
relevant to contemporary Jewish life.

Courses in Leadership Studies explore the phenomena of leadership in a wide
range of historical, cultural, organizational and intellectual domains. The
field of Leadership Studies recognizes that leading and following are basic
elements of interpersonal relationship and social organization, encountered
in all groups. While courses in this cluster may provide practical insights
into leadership, their principal purpose is to challenge students to appreciate
the complex social, psychological, ethical, and aesthetic issues facing leaders
of many kinds. These questions of leadership are studied so that throughout
their lives students may bring increased wisdom concerning this pervasive
phenomenon not only to their leadership roles but also to their varied
engagements in tomorrow's complex world.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students are encouraged to discuss their interest in Leadership Studies with
the Chair. Students can complete the recommended Leadership Studies curriculum
by taking two of the "cluster courses" listed below, two leadership studies
electives, also listed below, and EXPR 402, Topics in Leadership.

Courses in linguistics enable students to explore language from a variety
of perspectives: the internal workings of language as a system of communication,
the role of language in society, the history of language groups and specific
languages, and the applicability of scientific knowledge about language to
various human endeavors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Linguistics offers neither a major nor a concentration, but its courses
complement study in several other disciplines: Anthropology, Psychology,
Sociology, English, Literary Studies, and all the foreign languages. Anthropology
majors can receive major credit for Linguistics 101. Majors in German Studies
may receive major credit for a linguistics course with the special permission
of the department chair.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Knowledge of foreign languages is helpful but not required for Linguistics
101.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Note: Because of personnel changes, no courses in linguistics can be offered
in 1998-99. It is hoped that at least one course can be offered in 1999-2000

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Chair, Associate Professor HELGA DRUXES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Professors: GOLDSTEIN*, NEWMAN*, STAMELMAN***. Associate Professor: DRUXES.
Assistant Professors: CARTER-SANBORN, CASSIDAY, PEDRAZA*, ROUHI, SILBER.
Visiting Assistant Professors: BEILIN, GREENBERG, HACHMEISTER.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Literary Studies provides students with the opportunity to study the history
and theory of literature in an international context. The program offers
both a regular nine-course major and a selection of courses for all students.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Literary Studies major combines a focused study of a single national-language
literature with a wide ranging exploration of literary forms across national,
linguistic, and historical boundaries. Each student who declares the major
must select a single foreign language as his or her specialty. The languages
currently available are: French, German, Ancient Greek, Latin, Russian, and
Spanish. Each student will also be paired with a faculty adviser (usually
the Chair), with whom he or she shall meet at least once a semester in order
to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Nine courses are required for the major:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Three of the following five:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
English 101 Techniques of Reading
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Literary Studies 111 Introduction to Cultural Studies: Traveling Fictions
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Literary Studies 202 Literary Genres: The Nature of Narrative
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Literary Studies 203 Literary Movements: European Modernism: Modernity and
Its Discontents
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Literary Studies 205 Literature and Theory: Literature and Psychoanalysis
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Literary Studies 402 Issues in Literary and Cultural Theory
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Three literature courses in the student's specialty language, in which texts
are read in the original. At least one of the three must be above the 200
level.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two literature courses in which most of the course work concerns literatures
other than that of the student's specialty language. These courses may be
selected from Literary Studies offerings or from other literature departments
and must be approved by the student's major adviser. Only one may be in English
or American literature. Among the offerings of other departments that are
possible, the following employ readings in English translation and are especially
appropriate to the major:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Chinese 243 Gender Issues in Traditional Chinese Literature
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Chinese 244 Writer and Society in Twentieth-Century China
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Classics 101 Greek and Roman Epic
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Classics 103/Theatre 311 Greek and Roman Drama
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Religion 201 The Hebrew Bible as Literature
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Religion 211 Paul and the Beginnings of Christianity
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Spanish 306 Latino Writing: Literature by U.S. Hispanics
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russian 203 Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature in Translation
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who are considering a major in Literary Studies should aim to acquire
intermediate level proficiency in their specialty language by the end of
the sophomore year. They should also complete the 100- and 200-level core
course requirements by the end of their junior year. They are expected to
take the version of 402 offered in their senior year, even if they have
previously taken 402.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN LITERARY STUDIES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To achieve honors in Literary Studies a student must prepare a thesis, usually
50-75 pages long, during the senior year (LIT 493-W031-494). The topic must
be comparative and/or theoretical in approach and must include a significant
amount of material in the literature of the student's specialty language.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students must apply to the advisory committee of the program for permission
to pursue an honors project. The application must be submitted before the
beginning of the student's senior year.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
COURSES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Literary Studies 111, Traveling Fictions, 202, The Nature of Narrative, 203,
European Modernism, and 205, Literature and Psychoanalysis, are the core
courses of the program. They provide a foundation for the study of comparative
literature and literary theory. Literary Studies 111 and 205 are open to
all students without prerequisite. Literary Studies 202 and 203 are open
to all students who have completed English 101 (or the equivalent) or Literary
Studies 111 or 205.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other Literary Studies courses are also generally open to all students. Any
prerequisites are given in the individual course descriptions.

economics, should consider Mathematics 210, 243, 244, 305, 306, 315, 342,
346, 348, 354, 361, 433, 442, 448, 452, and additional appropriate courses
from outside Mathematics, including possibilities such as Chemistry 301,
Computer Science 256, Computer Science 361, Economics 255, Physics 201, Physics
202 or more advanced physics courses.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
BUSINESS AND FINANCE
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students interested in careers in business or finance should consider Mathematics
102 or 202, as well as courses in statistics and related areas such as
Mathematics 143, 243, 244, 342, 346, 348, 442 and 448. Since these courses
address different needs, students should consult with the instructors to
determine which seem to be most appropriate for individuals.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ENGINEERING
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students interested in engineering should consider the courses for applied
mathematics immediately above, with Mathematics 210 and 305 especially
recommended. Williams has exchange and joint programs with good engineering
schools. Interested students should consult the section on engineering near
the beginning of the Bulletin and the Williams pre-engineering advisor for
further information.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
GRADUATE SCHOOL IN MATHEMATICS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students interested in continuing their study of mathematics in graduate
school should take Mathematics 301 and 312. Mathematics 302 and 324 are strongly
recommended. Many of the 400-level courses would be useful, particularly
ones that involve algebra and analysis. Honors theses are encouraged. Reading
knowledge of a foreign language (French, German, or Russian) is helpful.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
STATISTICS AND ACTUARIAL SCIENCE
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students interested in statistics or actuarial science should consider
Mathematics 243, 244, 342, 346, 348, 442, 448 and Economics 255. Additionally,
students should consider taking some number of the actuarial exams given
by the Society of Actuaries, which can constitute part of a Honors program
in actuarial studies (see section on Honors below).
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
TEACHING
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students interested in teaching mathematics at the elementary or secondary
school level should consider Mathematics 243, 285, 313, 325, 381, and practice
as a tutor or teaching assistant. Winter Study courses that provide a teaching
practicum are also highly recommended.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The degree with Honors in Mathematics is awarded to the student who has
demonstrated outstanding intellectual achievement in a program of study which
extends beyond the requirements of the major. The principal considerations
for recommending a student for the degree with Honors will be: Mastery of
core material and skills, breadth and, particularly, depth of knowledge beyond
the core material, ability to pursue independent study of mathematics,
originality in methods of investigation, and, where appropriate, creativity
in research.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An Honors program normally consists of two semesters and a WSP (031) of
independent research, culminating in a typed thesis and a presentation. Under
certain circumstances, the honors work can consist of coordinated study involving
a regular course and one semester plus a WSP (030) of independent study,
culminating in a typed "minithesis" and a presentation. At least one semester
should be in addition to the major requirements.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An Honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on
four appropriate examinations of the Society of Actuaries and giving a second
colloquium talk. Written work is a possible component.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Highest Honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed
exceptional ability, achievement or originality. Such a student usually will
have written a thesis, or pursued actuarial Honors and written a minithesis.
An outstanding student who writes a minithesis, or pursues actuarial Honors
and writes a paper, might also be considered.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Prospective Honors students are urged to consult with their departmental
adviser at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore or at
the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of study that could
lead to the degree with Honors. By the time of registration during spring
of the junior year, the student must have requested a faculty member to be
Honors adviser and must have obtained the Department's approval of formal
admission to the Honors program. Such approval depends on both the record
and the promise of the applicant. It is conditional on continuing progress.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The recommendation for Honors is usually announced at the end of the spring
term. Participation in the Honors Program does not guarantee a recommendation
for Honors. The decision is based not only on successful completion of the
Honors Program but also on the merit of the student's overall record in
Mathematics. If the student completes the program during the fall or Winter
Study, the decision may be announced at the beginning of the spring term,
conditional on continuing merit.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Mathematics Department attempts to place each student who elects a
mathematics course in that course best suited to the student's preparation
and goals. The suggested placement in an appropriate mathematics course is
determined by the results of the Advanced Placement Examination (AB or BC)
if the student took one, and any additional available information. A student
who receives a 3, 4, or 5 on the BC examination or a 4 or 5 on the AB examination
is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 105. A student who receives a 1 or 2
on the BC examination or a 2 or 3 on the AB examination is ordinarily placed
in Mathematics 104. Students who have had calculus in high school, whether
or not they took the Advanced Placement Examination, are urged to register
for either Mathematics 104 or Mathematics 105. In any event, students registering
for mathematics courses are urged to consult with members of the department
concerning appropriate courses and placement. In general, students are encouraged
to enroll in the most advanced course for which they are qualified: it is
much easier to drop back than to jump forward. The department reserves the
right to refuse registration in any course for which the student is determined
to be over-prepared.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
GENERAL REMARKS
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Divisional Requirements
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All courses may be used to satisfy this requirement.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Alternate year courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Core courses 301, 305, 312, and 315 are normally offered every year. Other
300-level courses may be offered in alternate years. Senior seminars (400-level
courses) are normally offered every two to four years. Students should check
with the mathematics department before planning far into the future.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Course Admission
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites. Students
with questions about the level at which courses are conducted are invited
to consult members of the department.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Course Descriptions
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Descriptions of the courses in Computer Science are under that heading. More
detailed information on all of the offerings in the Department is available
in the Informal Guide to Mathematics Courses at Williams that can be obtained
at the departmental office.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Courses open on a pass/fail basis
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students taking a mathematics course on a pass/fail basis must meet all the
requirements set for students taking the course on a graded basis.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department
may be taken on a pass/fail basis. Permission will not be given to mathematics
majors to meet any of the requirements of the major or honors degree on this
basis. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the
department beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass/fail basis.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Graduate School Requirements
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics
as a prerequisite to admission or to attaining their degree. Students interested
in graduate or professional training in business, medicine, economics, or
psychology are advised to find out the requirements in those fields early
in their college careers.

Group A: any Music 106-Music 133 course, including direct supervision by
instructor in supplementary readings, assignments, papers, and other projects
appropriate for the music major.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Group B: Music 203T, 204T, 212, 301, 325, 326, 427, 428. <BR>
Department strongly recommends that students elect at least one course from
each group.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is strongly recommended that prospective majors complete Music 104, 201,
202, and 207 by the end of the sophomore year.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Performance and Concert Requirements
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Music majors are encouraged to participate in departmental ensembles throughout
their careers at Williams; i.e. for eight semesters. Majors are required
to participate in departmental ensembles for at least four semesters. The
student must petition to meet this requirement in an alternative way. Music
majors are also expected to attend departmentally-sponsored concerts.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Foreign Languages
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Music majors are strongly urged to take courses in at least one foreign language
while at Williams.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Musicianship Skills
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Music majors are strongly urged to maintain, refine and improve their
musicianship skills, such as sight-singing, score reading, melodic and harmonic
dictation, and keyboard proficiency, throughout their entire Williams career.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MUSIC
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Three routes toward Honors and Highest Honors are possible in the Music major:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
a. Composition: A Composition thesis must include one major work completed
during the senior year, a portfolio of smaller works completed during the
junior and senior years, and a 10 to 15 page discussion of the student's
work.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
b. Performance: A Performance thesis must include an honors recital given
during the spring of the senior year and a 15 to 20 page discussion of a
selection of the works performed. The student's general performance career
will also be considered in determining honors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
c. History, Theory and Analysis, or Ethnomusicology: A written Historical,
Theoretical/Analytical, or Ethnomusicological thesis between 65 and 80 pages
in length and an oral presentation based on the thesis is required. A written
thesis should offer new insights based on original research.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be admitted to the honors program, a student must have at least a 3.3
GPA in Music courses (this GPA must be maintained in order to receive honors),
and have demonstrated ability and experience through coursework and performance
in the proposed thesis area. A 1-2 page application to the honors program,
written in consultation with a faculty member, must be made to the Chair
of Music before or during spring registration in the junior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Honors candidates must enroll in MUS 493(F)-W031-494(S) during their senior
year. A student who is highly qualified for honors work, but who, for compelling
reasons, is unable to pursue a year-long project, may petition the department
for permission to pursue a thesis over one semester and the Winter Study
term. If granted, the standards for evaluating the thesis in such exceptional
cases would be identical to those that apply to year-long honors projects.
Final submission of the thesis must be made to the Music Department by April
15 of the senior year. The Department's decision to award honors will be
based on the quality of the thesis.
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
________________________________
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are three introductory courses in music at Williams College. The student
is urged to read the descriptions of Music 101, 102, and 103 and to consult
the instructors to determine which course will best assist his or her growth
in understanding music.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
This course is designed for students with a strong instrumental or vocal
background. Although there is no prerequisite, students are expected to be
proficient in reading at least one clef.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
NOTE: Prerequisites for Music 106 through 133
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For each course, varying degrees of musical experience are necessary. Students
may consult with the instructor or simply attend the first class meeting.
(Successful completion of Music 101 automatically qualifies the student for
Music 106 through 133.)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Tutorial in nature, these courses are for work of a creative nature, based
upon the talents and backgrounds of the individual student, working under
the close guidance of a member of the department to fulfill some project
established by the consent of teacher, student, and department. The election
is utilized to supplement the department's course offerings, and may include
such projects as:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
independent lessons in composition;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
independent study in the performance of and literature for voice, piano,
organ, or an orchestral instrument with participation in periodic Performance
Seminar required;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
coaching, rehearsal, and performance of instrumental or vocal chamber music;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
advanced work in music theory (critical methods and analysis, solfeggio,
keyboard harmony, ear-training and dictation, counterpoint and orchestration).
Prerequisite, Music 202;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
advanced studies in modal counterpoint (composition and analysis of contrapuntal
structure from 1150-1600, from Leonin through Lassus). Prerequisite, Music
301;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
advanced studies in tonal counterpoint (composition and analysis of contrapuntal
structures from 1600-1914, from Monteverdi through Schoenberg). Prerequisite,
Music 301;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
studies in issue areas such as acoustics and perception, philosophy and
aesthetics of music, women and minorities in music, music of non-western
cultures, music and technology;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
advanced work in music history;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
advanced studies in jazz improvisation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The project may be continued by the election of the next-higher numbered
course or another facet of the musical art. The specific name of the project
elected is to be specified after the title, "Musical Studies."

Chair, Associate Professor BETTY ZIMMERBERG

Advisory Committee: Professors: G. GOETHALS, SOLOMON, ZOTTOLI*. Associate
Professors: D. LYNCH, H. WILLIAMS, ZIMMERBERG. Assistant Professor: ADLER**.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Neuroscience is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field concerned with
understanding the relationship between brain, mind, and behavior. The
interdisciplinary nature of the field is apparent when surveying those who
call themselves neuroscientists. Among these are anatomists, physiologists,
chemists, psychologists, philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and
ethologists. The areas that neuroscience addresses are equally diverse and
range from physiological and molecular studies of single neurons, to
investigations of how systems of neurons produce phenomena such as vision
and movement, to the study of the neural basis of complex cognitive phenomena
such as memory, language, and consciousness. Applications of neuroscience
research are rapidly growing and include the development of drugs to treat
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease,
the development of noninvasive techniques for imaging the human brain such
as PET scans and MRI, and the development of methods for repair of the damaged
human brain such as the use of brain explants. Combining this wide range
of disciplines, areas of research, and application for the study of a single
remarkably complex organ-the brain-requires a unique interdisciplinary approach.
The Neuroscience Program is designed to provide students with the opportunity
to explore this approach.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE PROGRAM
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The program in neuroscience consists of five courses including an introductory
course, three electives, and a senior course. In addition, students will
be required to take two courses, Biology 101 and Psychology 101, as prerequisites
to the program.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Introduction to Neuroscience (NSCI 201) is the basic course and provides
the background for other neuroscience courses. Ideally, this will be taken
before the end of sophomore year. Either Biology 101 or Psychology 101 serves
as the prerequisite. Electives are designed to provide in-depth coverage
including laboratory experience in specific areas of neuroscience. At least
one elective course is required in Biology (Group A) and one in Psychology
(Group B). The third elective course may also come from Group A or Group
B, or may be selected from offerings from other departments. Topics in
Neuroscience (NSCI 401) is designed to provide an integrative culminating
experience. Most students will take this course in the senior year.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN NEUROSCIENCE
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The degree with honors in Neuroscience provides students with the opportunity
to undertake an original research project under the supervision of one or
more of the neuroscience faculty. In addition to completing the requirements
of the Neuroscience program, candidates for an honors degree must enroll
in NSCI 493-W031-494 and write a thesis based on an original research project.
Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee
of a degree with honors. Students interested in pursuing a degree with honors
should contact the Neuroscience Advisory Committee in the Spring of their
junior year.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
REQUIRED COURSES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(Both courses should be completed by the end of the sophomore year.)
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ELECTIVES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Three elective courses are required. At least one elective must be from Group
A and at least one elective must be from Group B. The third elective may
come from either Group A or Group B or the student may wish to petition the
advisory committee to substitute a related course from another department.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The peoples and cultures requirement is intended to help students to begin
to understand the cultural diversity of American society and the world at
large, so that, as citizens of an increasingly interconnected world, they
may become better able to respond sensitively and intelligently to peoples
of varied social backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill
this requirement are thus designed to familiarize students with some dimension
of American cultural diversity or that of the non-Western world. Each student
must complete one graded semester course primarily concerned with : (a) the
peoples and cultures of North America that trace their origins to Africa,
Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native American peoples and
cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of Africa, Asia, Latin America,
Oceania, or the Caribbean. Although this course, which may be counted toward
the divisional distribution requirement, may be completed any semester before
graduation, students are urged to complete the course by the end of the sophomore
year.

  PHILOSOPHY (Div. II)
</H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Chair, Associate Professor SAMUEL W. FLEISCHACKER
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Professors: SAWICKI, WHITE*. Associate Professors: FLEISCHACKER, GERRARD.
Assistant Professors: KAMTEKAR*, MLADENOVIC. Visiting Professor: KOJEN. Visiting
Assistant Professor: DUDLEY. Bolin Fellow: HERNANDEZ-LEMUS.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To engage in philosophy is to ask a variety of questions about the world
and our place in it. What can we know? What should we do? What may we hope?
What makes human beings human? These questions, in various forms, and others
like them are not inventions of philosophers; on the contrary, they occur
to most people simply as they live their lives. Many of us ask them as children,
but later either ignore them, or accept answers we can live with. Philosophers,
however, seek to keep such questions open, and to address them through reasoned
discussion and argument, instead of accepting answers to them based on opinion
or prejudice.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The program in philosophy is designed to aid students in thinking about these
issues, by acquainting them with influential work in the field, past and
present, and by training them to grapple with these issues themselves. The
program emphasizes training in clear, critical thinking and in effective
writing. Philosophy courses center around class discussions and the writing
of interpretive and critical essays.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Philosophy is a discipline with a long and intricate history, a history that
remains an integral part of the discipline. In this way, it differs dramatically
from the natural sciences: for example, although no contemporary physicists
or biologists embrace Aristotle's physics or biology, among philosophers
there continue to be champions of Aristotle's metaphysics and of his ethics.
Because of the richness and continuing importance of the history of philosophy,
the program is designed to give majors a historical background that will
acquaint them with a wide variety of approaches to philosophical issues,
and will provide them with a basis for evaluating and contributing to
contemporary debates.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A total of nine courses is required for the major in Philosophy. Students
should begin with Philosophy 101 and 102, in either order; both are required
for the major. These courses provide historical introductions to the two
major areas of philosophical inquiry, i.e., practical inquiry into issues
of ethics and politics, and theoretical inquiry into issues of knowledge,
belief, understanding, and reality. Following 101 and 102, students should
take 201 and either 202 or 204, again in either order; neither is required
for the major, but both are prerequisites for many upper-level courses, and
both are strongly recommended for students who think they may be interested
in pursuing graduate study in philosophy. The final required course is the
Senior Seminar, Philosophy 401.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Following your completion of 201 and either 202 or 204, you will have the
background you need in order to decide which five additional courses will
best complete your major. Members of the department will gladly advise you,
but you will have discovered which areas, topics, and figures are most important
to you. Non-majors are invited to ask the Chair for advice on course selection.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students considering graduate study in philosophy are strongly urged to develop
reading competence in German, French, or Greek before graduation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHILOSOPHY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The degree with Honors in Philosophy is awarded to the student who has
demonstrated outstanding achievement in a program of study that extends beyond
the requirements of the major. The extension beyond major requirements may
take the form either of independent work culminating in a senior essay or
thesis (the independent-study route) or of additional course work (the
directed-study route). Candidates must have GPA's of 3.3 or higher in their
courses in philosophy, both at the time of applying for candidacy and at
the end of senior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The independent-study route to honors requires the completion and defense
of either a senior essay produced in the fall semester plus winter study
period (maximum 40 pages) or a year-long senior thesis (maximum 75 pages).
Plans for either essay or thesis (including a brief proposal and bibliography,
worked out in consultation with an advisor) must be submitted to the department
in April of the junior year. A recommendation for graduation with honors
will be made on the basis of the thoroughness, independence, and originality
of the student's work.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The directed-study route to honors requires the completion of two courses
in philosophy in addition to the nine required for the major. Candidates
taking this route must also submit to the department copies of two term papers
(10 pages or longer) written for philosophy courses they have taken; the
papers may be revised on the basis of instructors' comments. A recommendation
for graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the scope of the
student's course work, the quality of the student's participation in Philosophy
402, and the thoroughness, independence, and originality reflected in the
submitted papers.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Chair, Associate Professor JEFFERSON STRAIT
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Professors: CRAMPTON*, JONES*, WOOTTERS. Associate Professor: STRAIT. Assistant
Professors: AALBERTS, S. BOLTON*, MAJUMDER. Visiting Assistant Professor:
KRAMER. Lecturer: BABCOCK. Laboratory Supervisor: FORKEY.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is light? How does a transistor work? What is a proton made of? Why
are metals shiny? Why is glass transparent? There are people for whom questions
like these are of more than passing interest; some of them become physics
majors. A physics student experiments with the phenomena by which the physical
world is known and explores the mathematical techniques and theories that
make sense of it. The major serves as preparation for further work in pure
or applied physics, other sciences, engineering, medical research, science
teaching and writing, and other careers involving insight into the fundamental
principles of nature.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to the physics major, the Physics Department also offers a major
in astrophysics, in cooperation with the Astronomy Department. That major
is described elsewhere in this Catalog.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Introductory courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students considering a major in physics should take both physics and mathematics
as first-year students. A student normally begins with either Physics 131
or Physics 141:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
1. Physics 131 Particles and Waves. This is designed as a first course in
physics. It is suitable for students who either have not had physics before
or have had some physics but are not comfortable solving "word problems"
that require calculus.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
2. Physics 141 Particles and Waves-Enriched. Students in this course should
have solid backgrounds in science and calculus, either from high school or
college, including at least a year of high school physics.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department of Mathematics will place students in the appropriate introductory
calculus course. The physics major sequence courses all make use of calculus
at increasingly sophisticated levels. Therefore, students considering a physics
major should continue their mathematical preparation without interruption
through the introductory calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, and 105).
Students are encouraged to take Physics 210 as early as possible. Mathematics
210 may substitute for Physics 210 but Physics 210 is recommended.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Advanced Placement
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students with unusually strong backgrounds in calculus and physics may place
out of Physics 141 and begin with Physics 142 in the spring. On rare occasions
a student with an exceptional background will be offered the option of enrolling
in Physics 201.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Placement is based on AP scores, consultation with the department, and results
of a placement exam administered during First Days. The exam can also be
taken later in the year by arrangement with the department chair. The exam
covers classical mechanics, basic wave phenomena, and includes some use of
calculus techniques.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Requirements for the major
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
A total of ten courses in physics and mathematics are required to complete
the physics major.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Required Physics Sequence Courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students entering with Advanced Placement in mathematics may obtain credit
toward the major for the equivalent Mathematics 105 taken elsewhere.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Electives
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At least two more physics or other approved courses must be taken, bringing
the total number of courses for the major to ten. The following provisions
apply to these elective courses:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
1. Mathematics 104 may be counted if taken at Williams
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
2. Mathematics 210 may substitute for Physics 210.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
3. Astronomy 111 may count in place of Physics 141 if a student places out
of 141 (see below).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
4. An additional astronomy or astrophysics course above the introductory
level that is acceptable for the astrophysics major may be counted.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
5. Two approved Division III courses above the introductory level may be
substituted for one physics course. Approval is on an individual basis at
the discretion of the department chair.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Preparation for Advanced Study
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who may wish to do graduate work in physics or engineering should
elect courses in both physics and mathematics beyond the minimum major
requirements. The first year graduate school curriculum in physics usually
includes courses in quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory, and classical
mechanics that presuppose intermediate level study of these subjects as an
undergraduate. Therefore, students planning graduate work in physics should
elect all of the following courses:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Physics 402T Applications of Quantum Mechanics
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Physics 405T Electromagnetic Theory
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Physics 411T Classical Mechanics and Fluid Mechanics
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Advising
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to consult with the department
chair or course instructors about course selections or other matters.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHYSICS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The degree with Honors in Physics will be awarded on the basis of a senior
thesis presenting the results of a substantial experimental or theoretical
investigation carried out under the direction of a faculty member in the
department. There is no rigid grade point average required for admission
to the program or for the awarding of the degree with honors, but it is normally
expected that honors students will maintain at least a B average in physics
and mathematics. Students will normally apply for admission to the program
early in the spring of their junior year and during senior year these students
will normally elect Physics 493, W031, and 494 in addition to the usual
requirements for the major. At the end of Winter Study, the department will
decide whether the student will be admitted to honors candidacy. Both a written
thesis and a colloquium presentation of the results are required. The degree
with honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with
distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to those who
fulfill them with unusually high distinction.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Honors candidates will also be required to participate in departmental colloquium
talks.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
OPTIONS FOR NON-MAJORS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many students want to take a self-contained and rigorous full-year survey
of physics. For such students, the most appropriate sequence will be either
Physics 131 or Physics 141 followed by Physics 132, depending on the student's
background in science and mathematics (see Introductory Courses above). Either
of these sequences satisfies the physics requirement for medical school.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The department also offers less quantitative or more specialized courses
for non-majors. This year there are two such offerings: Physics 100 and Physics
109.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Courses numbered 450 through 459 are independent reading courses in advanced
topics. Students will read a textbook or other material and work problems.
Once a week the students and the instructor will meet for discussion and
student presentations. Due to the initiative and independence required,
interested students should consult with the instructor before registering
for one of these courses. Enrollments will be limited, usually to 4 or fewer.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Political Economy major is designed to give students a grasp of the ways
in which political and economic forces interact in the shaping of public
policy. The major includes substantial study of the central analytical approaches
in both political science and economics and seeks to surmount the sometimes
artificial barriers of specialization that may characterize either discipline
taken by itself. In the junior and senior years a conscious merging of the
approaches in the two fields is undertaken in the three required Political
Economy courses. These courses are designed and taught jointly by political
scientists and economists. Political Economy 301 examines major writings
in political economy and analyzes economic liberalism and critiques of economic
liberalism in the context of current policy issues. Political Economy 401
examines interactions of political and economic forces in contemporary
international affairs. Political Economy 402 examines such interactions in
selected current public policy issues. Background for these senior courses
is acquired through a course in international economics and courses in domestic
and international/comparative politics and policy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students in Political Economy 402 visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through
Wednesday of the first week of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating
to their Political Economy 402 group projects. This is a course requirement.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Due to the special demands of this interdisciplinary major, the only route
to Honors in Political Economy is the thesis. Seniors may pursue the honors
thesis course (Political Economy 493-W031) during the fall semester and Winter
Study period. The third course contributing to such an honors program would
normally be an elective in Political Science, Economics, or Political Economy,
taken during the junior year. This course, which may be one of the required
electives, must be closely related, indeed must prepare the ground for the
honors thesis.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Juniors in the Political Economy major with at least a 3.33 G.P.A. in the
program may apply for the honors thesis program by means of a written proposal
submitted to the Chair before spring registration. Written guidelines for
such proposals are available in the Chair's office. The proposal should have
been discussed with at least two faculty members, and at least one faculty
advisor from each discipline should be solicited by the student prior to
submission of the proposal.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Final decisions about admission to the honors program will be made in early
summer, when spring grades become available.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To achieve the degree with honors in Political Economy, the thesis must be
completed by the end of Winter Study period and be judged of honors quality
by a committee consisting of the two advisors and a third reader. A thesis
judged to be of particular distinction will qualify its author for the degree
with highest honors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The numbering system for courses offered and required in Political Economy
is identical to the system outlined in the Williams College Bulletin (Catalog)
except that first-year students who have passed Economics 101 may enroll
in a 201- to 240-level economics course, to accelerate completion of the
introductory courses required in the Program.

  POLITICAL SCIENCE (Div. II)
</H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Chair, Professor MICHAEL D. MACDONALD
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Professors: COOK, JACOBSOHN*, MACDONALD, MARCUS*, A. WILLINGHAM. Associate
Professors: CRANE, C. JOHNSON***, MAHON, REINHARDT. Assistant Professors:
M. DEVEAUX, M. LYNCH, MCALLISTER, SHANKS. Visiting Assistant Professor: G.
RICHARDSON. Adjunct Professor: LEE*.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Politics is most fundamentally about community - it is how we manage to live
together and craft a common destiny. Communities, however, need power, and
political science therefore attends to the ways power is grasped, maintained,
challenged, or justified. The contest over power gives politics its drama
and pathos. Since power may be used wisely or foolishly, rightly or cruelly,
politics affects our lives most profoundly. No matter whether we find it
distasteful, inspiring, appalling or alluring, politics is for high stakes.
For this reason, the effort to understand politics aims not only to describe
and explain, but also to improve political life.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Political Science major is structured to allow students either to participate
in the established ways of studying politics or to develop their own foci.
To this end, the department offers two routes to completing our major, both
requiring nine (9) courses. On the one hand, we invite students to organize
their major through the subfields that structure the discipline of political
science (American politics, international relations, political philosophy,
and comparative politics). On the other, we encourage students to develop
individual concentrations reflecting their particular interests regardless
of subfields.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
SUBFIELD CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Upon declaring a major, students choose a subfield
from American politics, international relations, political theory, and
comparative politics. The subfield concentration draws at least four (4)
of the nine courses from one subfield, and includes the appropriate core
course from 201-204, two electives at the 200 or 300 level of the student's
choice and the senior seminar (or an individual project) in the student's
subfield. With permission of the department chair, students may take a senior
seminar in a different subfield, providing the student takes a third elective
in the subfield of concentration. In addition, students must take courses
in two subfields outside the subfield of concentration to satisfy the breadth
requirement (all courses at the 100 level and all methods courses also count
towards the breadth requirement).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
INDIVIDUAL CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Alternatively, students may devise a
concentration of their own. In this event, the student prepares a curricular
plan in consultation with a faculty advisor, explaining the nature of the
concentration and the courses the student will take. The individual concentration
also requires nine (9) courses, with at least five (5) thematically linked
courses constituting the concentration. Of these five courses, four are electives
at the 200 or 300 level, including one from 201-204, and one is a senior
seminar or individual project. In addition, students pursuing an individual
concentration must take at least two other courses that illustrate breadth
in political science. To complete the requirement, the student has his or
her choice of any two other courses within the Political Science Department.
The faculty advisor and the department chair must approve the student plan.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
ADVISEMENT
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When a student chooses to major in Political Science (usually at the end
of the sophomore year), he or she may register with any political science
faculty member at the designated time and places. The registering faculty
member will ask for preferences for a permanent faculty advisor and will
assist undecided students in finding an advisor whose interests match theirs.
In all cases students will be paired by the end of their sophomore year with
an advisor who will continue with them through graduation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
COURSE NUMBERING
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The course numbering used by the Political Science department reflects the
format and specialization of a course more than its level of difficulty.
The 100-level courses are designed to address questions of broad political
interest. The courses are pitched both to those considering and not considering
political science as a major. The 200-level courses are divided between our
core courses and our electives. The core courses, numbered between 201-04,
serve as introductions both to the substance of the politics and the subfields
organizing the study of politics. The core courses, which were previously
numbered at the 100 level, are open to all students, including first year
students and non-majors. The 200-level elective courses provide general overviews
of political processes, problems and philosophies in a way generally accessible
without prerequisites. 300-level courses are more specialized and usually
require prerequisites. 400-level courses are senior seminars offered for
students in the major; senior seminars also are open to juniors and to
non-majors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
WINTER STUDY PROJECT
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department welcomes relevant WSP 99 proposals that can make important
contributions to the students' understanding of public affairs and politics.
Majors, seniors, and students without previous WSP 99 experience have preference.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A major in Political Science can be readily and usefully combined with study
in a foreign country. Normally, no more than two semester courses taken abroad
in a program approved by the College may be counted toward the requirements
for a degree in Political Science.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Political Science Department grants Honors to candidates who, 1) complete
the Senior Seminar, 2) receive at least a grade of 3.50 on either a Senior
Essay (491-W030 or W030-492: Honors Route One) or a Senior thesis (493-W031-494:
Honors Route Two), and 3) have a minimum G.P.A. of 3.4 in Political Science.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To become a candidate for Honors, 1) the student must apply in the second
semester of junior year, 2) the research proposal must be acceptable to the
Department's Honors Committee, and 3) the applicant's G.P.A. in Political
Science courses for the first six semesters must be at least 3.4.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ADVANCED STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department of Political Science provides the opportunity for an unusually
gifted student to engage in an entire year's advanced research in American
politics under singularly favorable conditions. Supported by income derived
from an endowment fund, the student, designated the Sentinels of the Republic
Scholar (after the name of the fund), receives a substantial research stipend
to cover costs associated with the proposed project.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This unique research course (Political Science 481-W033-482) is designed
to encourage the pursuit of excellence among the most talented Williams students
of Political Science. Admission to it is awarded to the most distinguished
candidate on the basis of demonstrated capacity for outstanding work and
of the project's promise for creative contributions to the understanding
of American politics, political institutions and thought.

  RELIGION (Div. II)
</H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Chair, Professor WILLIAM R. DARROW
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Professors: DARROW, TAYLOR. Associate Professor: DREYFUS. Assistant Professors:
ANIDJAR, BUELL, RAMBELLI. Visiting Professor: SEGAL.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJOR
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The major in Religion is designed to perform two related functions: to expose
the student to the methods and issues involved in the study of religion as
a universal phenomenon of psychological, sociological, and cultural/historical
dimensions; and to confront students with the beliefs, practices, and values
of specific religions through a study of particular religious traditions.
It is a program that affords each student an opportunity to fashion his/her
own sequence of study within a prescribed basic pattern constructed to ensure
both coherence and variety. It consists of at least nine semester courses
as follows:
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Required sequence courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Religion 101 Introduction to Religion
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two seminars (courses numbered 301-309)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Religion 401-402 Issues in the Study of Religion
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Elective courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Four additional courses in Religion to be selected in such a way that at
least one course is taken in both the Western and non-Western traditions.
Students will construct their sequence in consultation with departmental
advisers and subject to their approval. In order to achieve a deep coverage
of a particular religious tradition or set of related problems in the study
of religion, students are urged to select three electives that together have
some kind of coherence, be it cultural, historical, or topical. Related courses
from other departments or programs may be included among the three courses,
and the point of coherence can be the subject of research papers in 401 and
402 seminars.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students are advised to elect additional courses in related fields (e.g.,
psychology, sociology, anthropology, art, history, philosophy) in order to
gain a clearer understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which
religions appear.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For those who wish to go beyond the formally listed courses into a more intensive
study of a particular religious tradition, methodological trend, or religious
phenomenon (e.g., ritual, symbol formation, mysticism, theology, etc.), there
is the opportunity to undertake independent study or, with the approval of
the department, to pursue a thesis project.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The value of the major in Religion derives from its fostering of a critical
appreciation of the complex role religion plays in every society, even those
that consider themselves non-religious. The major makes one sensitive to
the role religion plays in shaping the terms of cultural discourse, of social
attitudes and behavior, and of moral reflection. But it also discloses the
ways in which religion and its social effects represent the experience of
individual persons and communities. In doing these things, the major further
provides one with interdisciplinary analytical tools and cross-cultural
experience and opens up new avenues for dealing with both the history of
a society and culture and the relationships between different societies and
cultures. What one learns as a Religion major is therefore remarkably applicable
to a wide range of other fields of study or professions.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RELIGION
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The degree with honors in Religion requires the above mentioned nine courses
and the preparation of a thesis of 75+ pages with a grade of B+ or better.
A thesis may combine revised work done in other courses with new material
prepared while enrolled either in REL-493-W031 or REL W031-494. Up to 2/3
of the work in the thesis may be such revised work, but at least 1/3 must
represent new work. The thesis must constitute a coherent whole either by
its organizing theme or by a focus on a particular religious tradition.
Candidates will also be expected to present the results of their thesis orally
in a public presentation. Students who wish to be candidates for honors in
Religion will submit proposals and at least one paper that will be included
in the thesis to the Department in the spring of their junior year. Students
must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Religion to be considered for the Honors
program.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Chair will serve as advisor to non-majors.

  RELATED COURSE LISTINGS
</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are a number of significant areas of studies in which Williams offers
many relevant courses, yet no formal program. To alert students to the
opportunity for integrating courses from diverse disciplines into a focus
area and to encourage them to do so, the courses in this section are organized
as lists of topic-related courses. For their full descriptions, see the
respective departmental sections.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Studies
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies focuses on the social construction of
sexuality, past and present. Although, at present, Williams does not have
a formal concentration in gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies, the College
offers a number of courses which examine how social, cultural, and political
institutions shape sexualities, as well as the responses and resistances
thereto, through a variety of texts and contexts. The following courses include
significant components on gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies (at least two
weeks out of the semester).

  RUSSIAN (Div. I)
</H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Chair, Professor BRUCE KIEFFER
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Professor: GOLDSTEIN*. Assistant Professor: CASSIDAY. Visiting Assistant
Professor: E. JOHNSON. Teaching Associate: CHELUKHOVA.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
LANGUAGE STUDY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire
all four linguistic skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing.
Russian 101-W-102 covers the basics of Russian grammar. Russian 103 and 104
offer additional instruction in grammar and provide extensive practice in
reading and conversation. Russian 201 and 202 aim to develop facility in
speaking, writing, and reading. Russian 302 combines advanced language study
with the examination of various topics in Russian culture.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
STUDY ABROAD
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in
Russian to spend a semester or year studying in Russia or one of the former
Soviet republics. Students generally apply to one of several approved foreign
study programs. Russian 104 or the equivalent and junior standing are normally
prerequisite for study abroad.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department regularly offers courses on Russian literature in translation
for those students who have little or no knowledge of Russian, but who wish
to become acquainted with the major achievements in Russian literary and
cultural history.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE CERTIFICATE IN RUSSIAN
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the Certificate
in Russian offers a useful tool for using the language in a wide variety
of disciplines. The sequence of language and culture courses is designed
to supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to expand
his or her knowledge in a related field.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The course of study for the certificate gives credit for Russian 101 and
102, which do not count toward the major. Students who enter Williams with
previous training in Russian may substitute more advanced courses for the
100- and 200-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the
required courses. Thus, in order to earn a certificate a student must take
no fewer than five courses (including three language courses) after enrolling
at Williams.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence.
In addition, they must receive a score of at least 650 (out of a possible
800) on the ETS (Educational Testing Service) Comprehensive Proficiency Test.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Required Courses:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
101
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
102
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
103
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
104
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
201
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Electives:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
-at least one course on Russian cultural history
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
-at least one course on Russian intellectual, political, or social history,
or post-Soviet economics
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
MAJORS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department supports two distinct majors: Russian Literature and Russian
Studies.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Russian Literature
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Russian Literature major consists of ten courses. Students selecting
this major should usually have completed Russian 202 or the equivalent by
the end of the junior year. Majors will normally be expected to take a 400-level
Russian course in their senior year, even if they have previously taken another
400-level class.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Required Courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russian 103, 104 Intermediate Russian
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russian 201, 202 Advanced Russian
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russian 303, 304 Russian Literature in Translation
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russian 409 Russian Culture
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Electives
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Four other courses. At least two must focus on topics in Russian literature.
One may be a relevant course offered in other departments and programs such
as Literary Studies, History, and Music.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russian Literature majors may receive major credit for up to four courses
taken during study abroad.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Russian Studies
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russian Studies offers students an interdisciplinary approach to the intellectual
and cultural history of Russia and the former Soviet republics. Students
complete the major by combining courses in Russian language and literature
with courses in History, Political Science, Music, Economics, and Art.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Russian Studies major consists of ten courses. Students selecting the
major must normally complete Russian 202 or the equivalent by the end of
the junior year. Majors will normally be expected to take the version of
Russian 402 offered in their senior year, even if they have previously taken
another version.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Required Courses
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russian 103, 104 Intermediate Russian or the equivalent
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russian 201, 202 Advanced Russian
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russian 409 Senior Seminar
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Electives
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Five other courses drawn from Russian offerings above 202 and offerings in
other departments chosen in consultation with the chair of the Russian
Department. The electives must include courses from at least two departments
other than Russian. Examples of appropriate courses in other departments
are:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
History 232 Muscovy and the Russian Empire
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
History 233 The Rise of the Soviet Union
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Music 128 Masters of Russian and Soviet Music <BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russian Studies majors may receive major credit for as many as four courses
taken during study abroad.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RUSSIAN (with Area Studies)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the beginning of the second semester of the senior year, students may
nominate themselves to candidacy for the degree with honors. By the end of
the junior year at the latest, however, they will have established in
consultation with the Department their qualifications for embarking on the
project, the pattern of study to be followed, and the standards of performance.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students may earn a degree with honors by submitting a senior thesis (493-
W031-494) of honors quality.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Candidates for honors will normally be expected to complete a minimum of
nine courses plus a Winter Study project or the equivalent in the field.

  SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES (Div. II)

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Advisory Committee: Professors: D. BEAVER, DETHIER, L. KAPLAN, LEE*. Associate
Professor: ALTSCHULER.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Science and Technology Studies (SCST) is an interdisciplinary program concerned
with science and technology and their relationship to society. In addition
to being concerned with the historical development and a philosophical
understanding of the ideas and institutions of science and technology; Science
and Technology Studies also examines their ethical, economic, social, and
political implications.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The role that science and technology have played in shaping modern industrial
societies is generally acknowledged, but few members of those societies,
including scientists and engineers, possess any understanding of how that
process has occurred or much knowledge of the complex technical and social
interactions that direct change in either science or society. The Science
and Technology Studies program is intended to help create a coherent course
of study for students interested in these questions by providing a broad
range of perspectives. At the present time courses are offered which examine
the history or philosophy of science and technology, the sociology and psychology
of science, the economics of research and development and technological change,
science and public policy, technology assessment, technology and the environment,
scientometrics, and ethical-value issues.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To complete the requirements of the program, students must complete six courses.
The introductory course and senior seminar are required and three elective
courses are chosen from the list of designated electives. Students may choose
to concentrate their electives in a single area such as Technology, American
Studies, Philosophy, History of Science, Economics, Environment, Current
Science, or Current Technology, but are encouraged to take at least one elective
in History, History of Science, or Philosophy. The sixth course necessary
to complete the program is one semester of laboratory or field science in
addition to the College's three course science requirement. Other science
courses of particular interest include Chemistry 110 and Biology 134.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The program is administered by a Chair and an Advisory Committee of faculty
who teach in the program. Students who wish to enroll normally register with
the Chair by the fall of their junior year.

  SPANISH
</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Spanish major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level. These
nine courses include 301, any course 200 level or above, 401, and 402.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The major seeks to provide training in literary analysis and linguistic
expression, as well as an appreciation of Hispanic civilization, through
the study of the major writers of the Spanish-speaking world.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students majoring in Spanish and who are also registered in Latin American
Area Studies may replace one of their Spanish electives with an Area Studies
course offered in another department.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Inasmuch as all courses in Spanish assume the active participation of each
student in discussions conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance
at class meetings is expected.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN SPANISH
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree
with honors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis; honors candidates
are required to devote to their theses two semesters of independent study
(beyond the nine courses required for the major-and the Winter Study Period
of their senior year (493-W031-494). The thesis will be written in Spanish
and will usually be in the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates
are encouraged to submit thesis proposals in May of their junior year. By
the end of the first semester of the senior year, students will normally
have finished the research for the thesis. By the end of the Winter Study
Period, candidates will submit to the Department a completed first draft
of their work. At this time, the student will make a presentation of his
project at a departmental colloquium. The thesis will be discussed and evaluated
to determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors program.
The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising and
rewriting the thesis. The completed dissertation in its final form will be
due at the end of April.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by
the Department of Romance Languages or by other Departments, such as History,
Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which may be counted in the
nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent
Study (plus senior year WSP 030) in the spring of the senior year, at the
end of which the student will write an essay that synthesizes the content
of the three related courses. Students may apply for this route by November
2 of the senior year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the Department's
recommendation for graduation with honors will be based on the originality
and thoroughness of the finished project.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE CERTIFICATE IN SPANISH
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture consists of a sequence of
seven courses for which the student must earn a cumulative grade average
of B or higher. In addition, the student must take the ETS Comprehensive
Proficiency Test and achieve a score of "Advanced" in the reading and listening
portions, and a score of "Intermediate or Higher" in the speaking and writing
portions. The test will be administered by the Department once a year during
the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For students with no prior Spanish background, the course sequence will consist
of RLSP 101-102, RLSP 103-104, and three courses in Spanish above the 104
level, with at least one of these courses at the 200 level or higher. If
the student starts out the sequence at RLSP 103-104, in addition to the three
courses in Spanish beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or
higher), two electives may be taken in other departments. One elective should
be in Spanish or Latin American cultural history (art, literature, drama,
music) and the other in Spanish or Latin American intellectual, political,
or social history. RLSP 111, 112, or 208 can be counted for the elective
requirement.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
List of possible electives in other departments:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Anthropology 215 The Secrets of Ancient Peru
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Anthropology 216 Native Peoples of Latin America
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Anthropology 217 Mesoamerican Civilizations
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
ArtH 200 Art of Mesoamerica
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Political Science 344 Rebels and Revolution in Latin America
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Political Science 349 Cuba and the United States
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other electives may likewise be considered as departments create new courses.
However, students should consult with the Chair of Romance Languages before
making any enrollment decisions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
PLACEMENT
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A placement test in Spanish is administered at Williams at the opening of
the fall semester. Incoming first-year students who wish to register for
any Spanish courses above the 101 level must take this test.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
STUDY ABROAD
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Spanish majors, as well as non-majors interested in further exposure to the
language and the culture, are strongly encouraged to include study in Spain
or Latin America as part of their program at Williams. Through its special
ties with the Hamilton College Academic Year in Spain, the Department offers
a comprehensive linguistic and cultural experience in a Spanish-speaking
environment, for periods either of a semester or a year. Credit for up to
two courses per semester overseas can be granted toward the Spanish major.
Students interested in study abroad should consult with a member of the
Department at their earliest convenience.

BROTHERS, CATALANO.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a reflection of the theatre's historical relationship to literature and
the arts, stage production is studied in the context of the literary and
artistic movements which have informed theatrical endeavor. The major in
Theatre emphasizes the collaborative nature of the discipline by drawing
upon courses offered by faculty of the Language, Literature, Music, and Art
Departments. Although students will be equipped to proceed to graduate and
professional schools in Theatre, the major is primarily directed toward those
interested in studying the theatre as an artistic phenomenon and as an
interpretive tool. Because a deep understanding of theatre requires training
and experience with the synthesis on stage, the major includes curricular
study of production and performance, as well as continued participation in
departmental stage production.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Williamstheatre, the production arm of the Department of Theatre, operates
under the supervision of the departmental faculty. Major departmental productions
as well as laboratory and experimental productions of all kinds are mounted
on both the MainStage of the Adams Memorial Theatre, and the DownStage Theatre.
Participation in acting or technical work is open to all members of the Williams
College community. Students majoring in Theatre will be asked to consult
regularly with departmental advisers in devising the sequence of courses
and production participation that will constitute their major.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The course numbering system for the Department of Theatre follows the numbering
system of the College as a whole with two exceptions. Theatre 101, Introduction
to Theatre, and Theatre 102, Introduction to Technical Theatre, are limited
in their enrollment to first-year students and sophomores except in special
cases by permission of the instructor. The reason for this departure is to
keep these courses to a manageable size so that they can continue in their
present format as both lecture and laboratory.

The Department strongly recommends that students elect additional collateral
courses in dramatic literature taught by the English and modern language
departments, and courses in opera taught by the Music Department. Students
with an interest in theatre design should particularly elect Art Studio courses
in drawing.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Production requirement for the major: All Majors in Theatre are required
to participate in a minimum of eight productions in addition to the laboratory
requirement for Theatre 102. Participation in at least three of the eight
must be in technical production, and one must be in Stage Management. Assignment
to productions is normally made in consultation with the Department.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Theatre majors are strongly urged to include dance and fencing in fulfilling
their Physical Education requirements.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THEATRE
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students who intend to apply for the degree with honors must consult with
the department early in their junior year. At that time proposals for a specific
course cluster chosen to constitute an honors program must be submitted to
the department for its approval. A recommendation for graduation with honors
will be made on the basis of consistently superior performance in all aspects
of the major and fulfillment of the honors requirements with distinction.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The honors program consists of two elective courses outside the Theatre
Department, clearly related to the execution of a thesis or a project in
directing, performance, design, or writing for the theatre, and completion
of the project in Theatre 491 or 492 or the thesis in Theatre 493 or 494.
A Winter Study Project (W030 or W031) may be taken to augment the work completed
in one of these Theatre courses, but it is not required.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Courses elected in fulfillment of the honors program are not applicable to
the normal major requirement.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of interest to advanced students:<BR>
THE NATIONAL THEATRE INSTITUTE
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department of Theatre is affiliated with the National Theatre Institute,
which offers additional theatre study through its resident semester program.
The Institute is fully accredited by Connecticut College and is a member
of the Twelve-College Exchange. Limited numbers of Williams students can
therefore be selected to take a full semester of intensive theatre study
at the NTI, located at the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theatre Centre in Waterford,
Connecticut. During the semester, students from participating colleges live
and work as members of a theatre company gaining experience with professional
theatre artists in a workshop environment. Early application is essential.

  <A NAME="tutorial" HREF="#reftutorial" ></A>THE TUTORIAL PROGRAM AT WILLIAMS
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the Fall of 1988 Williams introduced a Tutorial Program. Students are
invited to examine the tutorial offerings carefully in order to understand
fully the substantive content of each tutorial and its mode of operation.
A list of the tutorials to be offered in 1998-99 is included in this section,
and a complete description of each may be found in the relevant department's
section of this catalogue. No student is required to take a tutorial, but
any student who has the appropriate qualifications is invited to do so.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the details of the functioning of tutorials will vary in order to
accommodate the diverse subject matter of the various departments of the
College, there are important common characteristics to which specific attention
may be called.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Tutorials place a much greater weight on student participation than do regular
courses or even small seminars. In general each tutorial will consist of
two students meeting with the tutor for one hour or 75 minutes each week.
At each meeting one student will make a prepared presentation-read a prepared
essay, work a set of problems, report on laboratory exercises, examine a
work of art, etc.-and the other student and the tutor will question, probe,
push the student who is presenting her work about various aspects of the
presentation. The student then must respond on the spot to these probings
and questions. A tutorial is directly concerned with teaching students about
arguments, about arriving at and defending a position, and about responding
on the spot to suggestions and questions. This kind of exercise will help
the student gain insight and understanding of what knowledge is and how it
is accumulated and how there can be different interpretations and different
understandings of the same phenomenon. The student presentation drives the
tutorial, and the presentation by the student obviously means that student
preparation and response are crucial to an effective tutorial. The presentation
is based on assigned and suggested reading and other work (laboratory, art
work, theatre, etc.) by the tutor.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In some tutorials both students will make a shorter presentation each week
and both will react and comment on the other's presentation. In all cases
the tutorial is built around presentations by students.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In most instances there will be no more than 10 students in a tutorial. In
the first and last week of the semester, the whole group will meet together,
and in the 10 weeks in between students will meet in pairs with their tutor.
Students should therefore expect to make 5 presentations that occupy about
an hour, or 10 that require one half hour. Assignments will be designed such
that the student should, in general, be required to spend no more time over
a week preparing for the tutorial than for a conventional course. It is likely
however that as a student begins her first tutorial course, she will have
to spend somewhat more time preparing for it than she does for her other
courses. Once the routine becomes more established and familiar, the tutorial
is expected to require about the same total time per week as does a regular
course. The student should appreciate, however, that the weekly tutorials
require exceptional regularity and on time performance.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Grading, testing, and similar details will be described by the tutor at the
first meeting of the entire group.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<TT>Drops and Adds</TT>. Because of the particular arrangements of the tutorial
it is necessary to limit adds to the first week of classes only. No adds
can be made after that time. Spaces in tutorials are limited, and a late
drop may unfairly deprive another student of an opportunity. Students are
urged therefore to think very carefully about their initial decisions.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
PLEASE NOTE: <TT>Tutorials cannot be taken on a pass/fail grading basis.</TT>

information about a specific tutorial from the assigned tutor.

  WILLIAMS-OXFORD PROGRAM
</H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Director, Professor ALAN WHITE
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE PROGRAM
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Williams College offers a year-long program of studies at Oxford University
in cooperation with Exeter College, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House
in North Oxford, the program is designed to integrate students into the
intellectual and social life of one of the world's greatest universities.
It uses the Oxford tutorial system and follows the Oxford three-term calendar.
The resident director administers Ephraim Williams House, oversees the academic
program, and serves as both academic and personal advisor to the students.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students in the Oxford Program enroll for the full academic year, which consists
of the Michaelmas, Hilary, and Trinity terms. These are each eight weeks
long (running from early October to early December, mid-January to mid-March,
late April to mid-June), and there are two intervening six-week vacations
during which students may be expected to continue reading as preparation
for upcoming tutorials.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Over the course of the three terms, students normally take four full tutorials
and one half tutorial, although some choose to substitute a fifth full tutorial
for the half tutorial.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE CURRICULUM
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth
studies, the program offers instruction in other fields for which Oxford
is particularly noted or which are represented only marginally or infrequently
in the Williams curriculum. Special provision is made for accommodating student
interests or curricular needs that extend beyond the fields of study listed
below. No disciplinary or departmental interest, therefore, is necessarily
excluded. Instruction is by tutorial, often supplemented by attending a program
of lectures or seminars from among the rich array sponsored by the University
each term.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In summary, all students enrolled in the Oxford Program are required to complete
four full tutorials and one half tutorial.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
TUTORIALS
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students elect four full tutorials and one half tutorial, and sometimes five
full tutorials, during the academic year. A full tutorial consists of eight
tutorial sessions, and a half tutorial of four tutorial sessions, during
an eight week term. Both full and half tutorials involve the following three
components: a) Tutorial meetings. These are weekly meetings of one or two
students with an Oxford tutor at which the students present an essay on an
assigned topic with discussion focusing on that topic. Eight essays in all
will be written for each full tutorial subject and four essays for a half
tutorial subject; b) Set readings. At the start of the term tutors will assign
a list of readings which students will be expected to complete on their own
during term time and the vacation; c) Lectures. Students may be encouraged
to follow a pertinent lecture course (consisting usually of eight lectures)
offered by the University in the general area of the tutorial subject.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Grades and Credits
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Grades for each tutorial reflect the mark assigned to all eight (or four)
tutorial sessions, including their related essays, considered together, as
well as the mark for the final examination on work accomplished in the tutorial
and supplementary reading. Final examinations are three hours in the case
of full tutorials and two hours in the case of half tutorials. The final
grade recorded on the Williams transcript is calculated by counting the tutorial
mark as two-thirds and the final examination mark as one-third.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Upon satisfactory completion of the requirements for the Williams College
Oxford Program students receive academic credit for a full Williams academic
year. Grades are incorporated into their Williams transcript and are included
in the computation of their G.P.A.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Tutorials may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement;
a student may earn a maximum of three distribution credits, with no more
than one from each division, for the year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
NON-CREDIT FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to their required tutorials, students may begin or continue the
study of a wide range of foreign languages on a non-credit basis through
a variety of arrangements available through the University as well as a number
of other educational and cultural institutions in the city of Oxford. Such
study normally is subsidized by the program.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
STUDENT LIFE
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Williams College Oxford Program offers students every opportunity to
integrate themselves fully into life at Oxford. The University offers access
to an exceptional variety of sports, societies, interest groups, activities,
and cultural events. Students are closely associated with their counterparts
at Exeter College, are able to share in the social life of the College, to
use its athletic facilities, and to dine in Hall twice a week. They have
access to the University's athletic events, concerts, theatrical productions,
museums, and to some of its many libraries. All may become members of the
Oxford Union Society which, in addition to its debating activities and club
rooms, possesses dining facilities and the largest lending library in the
University. Students are housed (in doubles) at Ephraim Williams House, which
is equipped with its own library and common rooms as well as with laundry
and dining facilities, and which serves one catered dinner a week during
the term. Each residential unit has fully-equipped kitchens for students
who wish to do their own cooking. The House is within easy walking distance
of the University Parks, convenient to the Summertown complex of shops and
restaurants, and about five minutes by bicycle from the heart of the University.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is an orientation period in October before the beginning of the academic
year to help acquaint students with Oxford and the opportunities and challenges
they will meet during the year. Throughout the academic year provision will
be made for day trips to such nearby points of interest as Stratford, Stonehenge
and Avebury, Bath, Wells, Chepstow Castle and Tintern Abbey, and Parliament
in London. Students will also attend a number of theatre productions and
other cultural events. In addition, Oxford's proximity to London gives students
ready access to that city's multiple attractions and resources. The Oxford-London
train service is an hourly one, and the journey takes about an hour. Buses
run even more frequently, and the journey takes about an hour and a half.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
ILLNESS AND INSURANCE
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
You must be covered either by the Williams college student health insurance
policy or some other comprehensive insurance plan (generally your family's
health insurance). While in the U.K., you will be covered under the National
Health Service (NHS) for routine clinic visits at the Exeter College group
medical practice and for emergency hospital treatment. Prescription drugs
are available through the NHS at a nominal fee. There are only limited outpatient
psychological counseling services available through NHS and the Oxford Program.
Any extensive or long-term counseling would have to be covered by your personal
health insurance policy. Finally, you are not likely to be covered under
NHS for medical services received in other foreign countries, especially
non-European Community countries.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
FEES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tuition and room fees for the program are equivalent to those for a year
at Williams. Students are responsible for their own transportation, most
of their meals, and personal expenses. For planning purposes, students and
their parents should expect the cost of a year on the Williams College Oxford
Program to be about the same as a year at Williams. Financial aid eligibility
will be figured on the usual basis of tuition, fees, room, board, and personal
and book expenses just as if the student were at Williams. Similarly, the
normal self-help contribution will be expected. Since the academic year ends
later at Oxford than at Williams, the summer earning expectation for the
following year will be reduced by one half and the difference made up by
additional Williams aid.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
APPLICATION
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Admission to the Program is on a competitive but flexible basis. Students
must apply to the Dean's Office by the prescribed deadline (normally in late
February) and, prior to applying, should consult with the chair of their
major department. They can expect to be notified of acceptance before Spring
Break. It is the normal expectation that they will have completed the College's
distribution requirement by the end of their sophomore year. The Admissions
Committee takes the G.P.A. into account and expects applicants to have
demonstrated capacity for independent work. Applicants must identify two
Williams faculty members who are willing to provide references (the Committee
will not request those faculty members to write letters but will want to
contact them). Because of the emphasis at Oxford on written work, at least
one of those faculty members should be able to offer an assessment of the
applicant's writing ability.

  WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES (Div. II)
</H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Chair, Professor JANA SAWICKI
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Advisory Committee: Professors: I. BELL, BUNDTZEN, SAWICKI. Associate Professors:
ROSEMAN, WATERS. Assistant Professors: BUELL, CARTER-SANBORN, DIGGS, KENT.
Lecturer: MATTHEWS. Affirmative Action Officer: MCINTIRE. Librarian: STEVENS.
Health Educator: DENELLI-HESS.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Women's and Gender Studies can be defined as the study of how gender is
constructed, how it is inflected by differences of race, ethnicity, sexuality,
class, etc., how gender affects the experiences and situations of men and
women, and how assumptions about gender influence the construction of knowledge
and experience. The program in Women's and Gender Studies is therefore open
to students majoring in a wide variety of disciplines who wish to focus in
a coherent way on gender issues. The program is designed to introduce students
to scholarship in Women's and Gender Studies, which has brought neglected
material into established fields and raised important methodological questions
about sex and gender that cross disciplinary boundaries and challenge established
intellectual frameworks.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To fulfill the requirements for a concentration in the Women's and Gender
Studies Program, students will take five courses. Women's and Gender Studies
101, Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies, introduces students to major
works in the development of modern feminist thought and to issues central
to Women's and Gender Studies. Students are encouraged to take Women's and
Gender Studies 101 in their first or second year. In addition, students elect
three Women's and Gender Studies courses from at least two departments. Electives
will vary according to the course offerings each year. Students may develop
a student-initiated course as an elective. In order to confront the breadth
of issues raised by Women's and Gender Studies as an interdisciplinary mode
of inquiry, students are advised to distribute their choices as widely as
possible. In their junior or senior year, after taking Women's and Gender
Studies 101 and two electives, one of which may be taken concurrently, students
are required to take a Women's and Gender Studies seminar, in which they
will write a substantial essay or develop a project in an area of special
interest. This seminar explores topics in Women's and Gender Studies. The
topic varies from year-to-year. Under exceptional circumstances, the chair
can allow an independent study to substitute for the seminar. Students may
take more than one seminar, space permitting.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Students are urged to declare a concentration in the Women's and Gender Studies
Program by the Fall semester of their junior year. To do this, or to obtain
further information about the Program, contact the Women's and Gender Studies
Chair, Stetson D13, X2305.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
CONTRACT MAJOR IN WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In consultation with the Chair of Women's and Gender Studies, students may
develop a contract major proposal in women's or gender studies. Interested
students should meet with the Chair in the first semester of the sophomore
year. Students proposing a contract major should take WOST 101 and plan to
take WOST 402 in their junior or senior year. Contract major proposals must
be approved by the Committee on Educational Policy.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Honors in Women's and Gender Studies may be granted to concentrators or contract
majors after an approved candidate completes a thesis (493-W031, W031-494)
or honors project (491-W030, W030-492), delivers a public presentation of
the work, and is awarded an honors grade by her/his adviser and one other
reader from the Women's and Gender Studies program.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The honors project may be one semester (plus Winter Study) or a year-long
project. It may consist of a conventional research thesis of 40-70 pages
or of other modes of presentation (e.g., art, music, poetry, theater, fiction).
Proposals for non-thesis projects may include evidence of experience and
competence in the chosen mode.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A student may become a candidate for honors in Women's and Gender Studies
after the following criteria are met:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
1) in April of the junior year, submission and Women's and Gender Studies
Committee approval of a 4- to 6-page project proposal, in which the ideas,
aim, general methodology, and preliminary bibliography for the project are
outlined and a faculty adviser is named;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
2) at the end of the junior year, cumulative grade point average of B+ from
courses in two of the three academic divisions (Humanities, Social Science,
Natural Science);
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
3) on the first day of classes of the senior year, submission and approval
by the faculty adviser of a 5- to 10-page prospectus for the project.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All honors work, including the public presentation will be graded by at least
two faculty members-a third will be consulted if there is a significant
discrepancy between the first two graders. Readers' grades will be averaged
and honors will be awarded as follows: A+/A Highest Honors; A-/B+ Honors.
