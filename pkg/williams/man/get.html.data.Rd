Extract Faculty Data from html Files

\description{
get.html.data reads in Williams College faculty data from .txt files that
were generated from html files downloaded for academic years
1998-2000. The html files were converted to txt and scrubbed to
facilitate the read-in process in R. See the package README.txt file for
additional details on the conversion and scrubbing. get.html.data returns
a dataframe containing all the faculty data for those years.
