Extract Faculty Data from pdf Files

\description{
get.pdf.data reads in Williams College faculty data from .txt files that
were generated from pdf files downloaded for academic years
2001-2010. The pdf files were converted to txt and scrubbed to
facilitate the read-in process in R. See the package README.txt file for
additional details on the conversion and scrubbing. get.pdf.data returns
a dataframe containing all the faculty data for those years.
